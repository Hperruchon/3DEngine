# Codebase review — 2026-11-08

This document uses Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100). See `CLAUDE.md`, section "Language".

The review examines `main` at `2ead6ae`, the merge of v0.275. Twelve ledger entries follow the review of v0.263, with two
product milestones (K5c and P9f); the next entry would make the review late. Two agents examined two areas at `b28ba10`,
the change of P0.122, whose code is the code of `2ead6ae`: the engine, the kernel, the backend, the surface and the reader;
and the desktop, the phone, Vulkan and the tests. Each agent proved its main findings with probes that it deleted. The
reviews of Codex of v0.264 to v0.271 gave leads that TASK-0284 to TASK-0287 fixed; no review draft of Codex exists for
v0.263.

## Summary

- **The fixes of the last review hold.** Each finding of the review of 2026-11-07 (c) is fixed, except E182, whose answer A
  waits for the check of the owner. V134 and T174 are fixed for their forms. **[Observed]**
- **A record was false.** The reviews of 2026-11-07 (b) and (c) counted V124 as fixed while its second part (a lost surface
  in the start of the engine of the phone) was open. TASK-0286 and TASK-0287 fixed it. **[Observed]**
- **One new finding is high.**
  - V141: the main run of v0.273 (42433201851) ended with a native crash of the program of the phone on the emulator, after
    a lost surface in the start of the engine. Five runs of the same code passed. **[Observed]** by the run. The bytecode
    of SDL gives the probable cause: the return of the main function of a stale session finishes the newest activity and
    clears its thread, so its destroy ends SDL while its session still runs. **[Inferred]** from the bytecode.
- **Two new findings are medium.**
  - E186: an inward-wound mesh passes `ISolidMeshOps.CreateSolid` with no error, and no test of the cone catches it; the
    Manifold body then has a negative volume, and a cut makes a plate larger. The mesh of the cone is right today.
    **[Observed]** by a probe and an injection.
  - E190: since TASK-0281 the client gives `E-STL-TOO-LARGE` for a file of more than 16 MiB, while `docs/diagnostics.md`
    gives the code the meaning "more triangles than the limit"; `CLAUDE.md` forbids a change of the meaning of a code.
    **[Observed]** by reading.
- **Eight new findings are low:** E187, E188, E189, E191, E192, V140, T175 and T176. **[Observed]**
- **The owner answered the open decisions on 2026-11-08** (the entry v0.273). K5d (the sphere and the torus) waits for a
  new question: a cut with a sphere of 3968 triangles took about 3 minutes in the exact kernel. **[Observed]**
- **Open findings: 0 critical, 5 high, 17 medium and 27 low.** **[Observed]**

## Measures

Each review repeats these measures at its commit, so that two reviews show how the code changes. A source
line is a line of a `.cs` or `.razor` file that git tracks.

| Measure | Value | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Projects in the solution | 17 | `.csproj` lines in `3DEngine.sln`. The last review gave 17; `3DEngine.Android` is outside the solution. |
| Production source lines | 33,317 | Each tracked `.cs` and `.razor` file outside `Engine.Tests`, `3DEngine.Tests`, `3DEngine.ImageTests` and `3DEngine.VisionTests`, 305 files. The last review gave 32,827 in 302 files. |
| Test source lines | 39,122 | `Engine.Tests` (26,426 in 121 files), `3DEngine.Tests` (3,616 in 22 files), `3DEngine.ImageTests` (9,015 in 56 files) and `3DEngine.VisionTests` (65 in 1 files). The last review gave 38,524. |
| Tests | 2,105 | `dotnet test 3DEngine.sln` at the change of P0.122: 1,428, 337, 337 and 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. The last review gave 2,077. |
| Gate classes | 20 | Tracked files whose name ends in `GateTests.cs`. `eng/repo-gates` gives 470 runs of 163 checks. The last review gave 20, and 470 runs of 163 checks. |
| Build warnings (clean build) | 0 | `dotnet build 3DEngine.sln --no-incremental`. |
| Open register entries | 15 | Section "Open" of `docs/register.md`; the limit is 15. The last review gave 15. |
| ADRs | 82 | `docs/adr/0001` to `0061` and `0070` to `0090`, with 0003 and 0011 in `docs/adr/archive/`. In force: 80 (37 accepted, 43 amended). None is proposed. The last review gave 80. |
| Findings: critical | 0 | Each finding that is open at this commit, from any review. The last review gave 0. |
| Findings: high | 5 | The same method: V2, V3, T4, T31, V141. The last review gave 7; E180, E181 and V134 are fixed. |
| Findings: medium | 17 | The same method: E5, E6, E12, E13, E19, E21, E22, V4, T2, T5, T10, T17, T32, T37, E182, E186, E190. The last review gave 20; E183, E184, V135, V136 and T174 are fixed. |
| Findings: low | 27 | The same method: E17, E24, E34, E39, E57, E84, E160, V7, V15, V29, V84, V88, T7, T13, T23, T25, T143, C1, P1, E187, E188, E189, E191, E192, V140, T175, T176. The last review gave 23; E185 and V137 to V139 are fixed. |
| Lines in the rule files | 3,040 | The ten rule files of `docs/reviews/2026-09-25-rules-review.md`, section 1, that still exist, counted with the method of that section. The last review gave 3,008. |
| Sentences with "must" | 59 | `grep -o -w -i must` on the same ten files. The last review gave 59. |
| Sentences with "do not" | 55 | `grep -o -i -E '\bdo not\b'` on the same ten files. The last review gave 55. |

A finding that is "fixed for its forms" counts as fixed: a new identifier holds each form that a later probe
found. E13, T32, E84, E160 and V84 are fixed in part and count as open. A finding that the owner accepted counts as closed.

## Findings of the previous review

The lines up to T173 are the lines of the review of 2026-11-07 (c); this review did not examine them again, except E164
(the HTTP answer of a save, TASK-0291) and V124 (its second part, TASK-0286 and TASK-0287). The lines of E180 to E185, V134
to V139 and T174 follow them, with the evidence of this review. The draft of Codex at `2a3d55c` gives E57, E160 and T32 as
fixed; this review did not check them, so they count as open.

- **E159** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the host compares the unsaved folder with no case on Windows and macOS.
- **E160** — Fixed in part. TASK-0242, v0.229, for the reasons of `DatumResolver`; the comment of `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs` stays, because the task forbade `Engine.Contracts`.
- **E161** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the probe holds a circle, a cylinder, a move and a cut; run 42290937312 gave `1c56cbdd...30ba` on the four platforms.
- **E162** — Fixed. TASK-0241, v0.226: a save to a new name copies the lines into the new file and then deletes the old one.

- **V105** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0243, v0.228 showed the cause (a new start of the activity, run 42289169473), and TASK-0247, v0.231 sets the hint of a new start; a new start during a session is V112.
- **V106** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the line of the first frame comes after a submitted frame; no test, because the presenter needs a surface.
- **V107** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the outline of the face follows the offset of a drag.
- **V108** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: only `CancelIntent.ByKey` goes back from the face.
- **V109** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the entry of the face is kept by the geometry key of the body.
- **V110** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the comments say that no run shows the order of the background.
- **V111** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: ADR-0075 names the files of its items 2 and 3.
- **T152** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the comparison runs when the gate passed; run 42289169473 compared the three desktop hashes with the emulator job failed.
- **T153** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the smoke test fails on a native crash of the program.
- **T154** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224: the start is one notice, and the line "ended" is the text of the failure.
- **T155** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the pin rule decodes escapes, and a property in an Update or a Remove is an offence.
- **T156** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a Remove or an Update of a SupportedPlatform is an offence.
- **T157** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a hash with no line of the probe fails with its reason.
- **T158** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224 and TASK-0242, v0.229: each call of adb has a limit.
- **T159** — Fixed. The entry v0.225 names the seven runs; each later entry names its failed runs.
- **E164** — Fixed in part. TASK-0251, v0.237. `MoveTo` gives the path of a kept old file
  (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:191`), and `SaveAs` adds `W-IO-OLD-FILE-KEPT`
  (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` to `113`). A failed copy cuts the new file first (`DocumentJournal.cs:177`). The
  form with a cut that fails too is E168. Since TASK-0291 (v0.275, ADR-0090, the answer of the owner of 2026-11-08) the HTTP answer of a save lists the warning too.
- **E165** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Edges` gives each pair of names of an edge (`Engine.Core/Queries/GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:160`
  to `170`). The outline takes only an edge with a face of the name and a face of another name (`GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:131`).
  ADR-0077 item 6 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:99` to `102`) decides it. The probe gives 6 edges
  on the z axis. Its test is weak (E169).
- **E166** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs:3` to `6` names `CreateCylinder`.
- **V112** — Fixed. TASK-0250, v0.235. `Window` is `IDisposable` and destroys its SDL window one time
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.cs:27-45`); `PhoneHost.Run` disposes it at the end of the session (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:56`);
  `WindowLifecycleTests.cs:13-30` holds it. TASK-0255 (v0.238) adds the turns for a new create during a session.
- **V113** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Forget` removes the kept entry of a body with a fault (`3DEngine.App/BodyActions.cs:273-278`).
- **V114** — Fixed for an open panel. TASK-0252, v0.240. A size constraint and `KeepAboveAnchors` hold it
  (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Panel.cs:20`, `:30`, `:256-263`). A collapsed panel still covers Undo (V123).
- **V115** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The unit comes before the name (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:268-271`).
- **V116** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. While a list is open, each point belongs to the panel (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.cs:379-382`).
- **V117** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The host asks for the edge before the pick (`BodyActions.cs:79-83`).
- **V118** — Fixed for the panel, the anchors and the status line. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Window.SafeInsets` reads
  `SDL_GetWindowSafeArea` (`Window.cs:203-213`), and `DesktopUi.Fixed.cs:29`, `:45` and `DesktopUi.Panel.cs:19` read the
  inset. The tool ring does not read it (V122).
- **T160** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. The correction of the entry v0.237 (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md:7135` to `7145`) names 42280512471 the ninth failure and moves the later numbers by one. The API gives three failed runs after 42298165211: 42308415060, 42310351172 and 42313242154. The entries v0.237, v0.238 and v0.239 name each of them.
- **T161** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:1522` refuses `*` and `?` in the `Update` and the `Remove` of a package item. The comparison with the evaluated version stays open, as the entry v0.237 says (line `7131`).
- **T162** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:639`, `643`, `656` to `658` and `667`, and the new step `eng/android/check-platforms.js` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:251` to `252`). Two new silences pass each gate (T165). Three projects of the phone do not need a silence (T166).
- **T163** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `eng/android/native-crash.ere` holds three patterns, `eng/android/smoke-emulator.sh:127` gives them to `grep -E -f`, and line `76` reads the log again after 5 seconds. My `grep -E -f` probe matched the line of libc with `(eedengine.phone)` and the line `Cmdline:`, and did not match the line of `com.android.systemui`.
- **T164** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. The affects fields of ADR-0076 (`docs/adr/0076-the-cylinder.md:11` to `23`) and ADR-0077 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:11` to `20`) name the eight files. No gate compares an affects field with the commit of its task, and the defect came back in ADR-0082 and ADR-0083 (T167).
- **E167** — Fixed. TASK-0262, v0.245. `DocumentFile.Check` takes an `IAssetSource` and gives it to the scratch session (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentFile.cs:91`, `:96`). `DesktopDocument` keeps the store (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs:24-29`) and passes it to the check (`DesktopDocument.cs:97`). `DesktopSession.Open` gives the store of the desktop (`3DEngine/DesktopSession.cs:48-49`). The test `The_Check_Of_An_Open_Reads_The_Asset_Of_An_Import_From_The_Store` holds the probe of review 28 (`3DEngine.ImageTests/DesktopDocumentTests.cs:135-161`).
- **E168** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `MoveTo` keeps the results of the cut and the delete, and it throws an
  `IOException` that names the new file when both fail (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:178` to `186`,
  `:201` to `227`). `DocumentSession.SaveAs` gives that message in `E-IO-SAVE-FAILED` (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` and `:116`
  to `118`). ADR-0015 item 9 agrees (`docs/adr/0015-command-log-persistence.md:105` to `106`). The test
  `A_Failed_Copy_Whose_Cut_And_Delete_Fail_Names_The_New_File_In_The_Error` (`Engine.Tests/Persistence/DocumentFileTests.cs:796`)
  holds the form.
- **E169** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The test of an edge of four faces requires six edges on the axis and six
  different pairs of the four names (`Engine.Tests/Features/GetFacesTests.cs:293` to `298`). An injected list of two axis
  edges passed the old assert and failed the new one (entry v0.250).
- **E170** — Fixed for its three forms, and the fix has a regression. TASK-0263, v0.250. Probe `reader`: a cut binary
  file with a "solid" header gives `E-STL-TRUNCATED` (form 23), a name "facet" or "old endsolid copy" reads (form 17 and
  the test at `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs:100`), and a byte order mark reads (form 12). The new rule "the name
  is the rest of the line" refuses a one-line file with a line end, and it silently drops a facet that is on the line of
  `solid` (E173).
- **E171** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `apply` and `query` read `--kind` and `--folder` in any order before the first
  `--param` (`Engine.Cli/Cli.cs:473` to `501`), `export` reads `--folder` after its three words (`Cli.cs:198` to `207`),
  and `BuildSession` opens that store (`Cli.cs:521`). The usage says so (`Engine.Cli/Usage.cs:14` to `29`). Probe `cli`:
  `asset put --folder` and then `apply ImportStl --kind part --folder` gave `Applied`; a second `--folder` gave the usage
  error "'--folder' comes one time only"; `export stl a.3de b.stl --folder` with no path gave exit 2.
- **V119** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `OpenPad` clears `_pendingValue` (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Pad.cs:43-50`). `Use` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:87-89`), and `OpenDistancePad` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Pad.cs:58-62`). Test `The_Pad_Of_Another_Tool_Ends_The_Pending_Chip` (`3DEngine.ImageTests/EdgeValueTests.cs`, added by TASK-0264).
- **V120** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The ring skips a release on a chip of the last frame and on a row (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:126-132`). The chip skips a release on a row (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:55-58`). Test `A_Tap_On_A_Chip_Over_A_Segment_Gives_The_Chip_Only` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). Note: the ring reads the chips of the last frame (`Ring` runs before `Values`, `DesktopUi.cs:548-550`), so a chip that moves in this frame is one frame late. I found no case where this gives two tools.
- **V121** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The portrait segment is `min(0.42, (π/2 − (n−1)·0.04)/n)` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:86`). Theory `Each_Segment_Of_A_Portrait_Ring_Is_Between_The_Left_And_The_Top` (`ToolRingTests.cs`).
- **V122** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `Layout` takes the inset (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:81`, `:87`), and `Ring` passes `_inset` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:121`). Test `The_Portrait_Ring_Is_Inside_The_Safe_Area` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). No device ran it.
- **V123** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `KeepAboveAnchors` runs after `Begin` for each state (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:28-32`). The left clamp is `16 + _inset.X` (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:264`). The comment is next to the clamp and agrees with it (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:256-258`). Test `A_Collapsed_Panel_That_The_Person_Drags_Does_Not_Cover_Undo` (`FixedControlsTests.cs`).
- **V124** — Fixed in part. TASK-0265, v0.246. A lost surface in `engine.Render()` now gives `Session.Background`
  (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:177` to `185`), and the destroy line names `IsChangingConfigurations` and the mask
  (`3DEngine.Android/MainActivity.cs:303`). Two parts stay open. First, the wait for the foreground checks the turn only
  after 500 ms with no event, and a foreground event returns `true` with no check of the turn (`PhoneHost.cs:207` to
  `223`). ADR-0079 item 4 says that the wait ends a session whose turn is stale (E172). Second, the guard covers `Render`
  only: `engine.Initialize()` at `PhoneHost.cs:143` to `144` has no guard. The ledger says that no run executed the new
  path (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`, entry v0.246, "What stays"). The second part is fixed since TASK-0286 (v0.271): the start of the engine has the guard of a frame; TASK-0287 (v0.272) makes the support query of the surface check its result, so the guard takes it. The reviews of 2026-11-07 (b) and (c) counted V124 as fixed while this part was open.
- **T165** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `Engine.Tests/Governance/DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:666` to `669` refuse a
  `#pragma warning disable` with no code (the regex at line `689`). Lines `680` to `682` refuse each
  `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.` line in each `.editorconfig` and `.globalconfig` (the walk at lines `700` to `717`).
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js:33` to `42` and `66` to `78` build a probe call in each of the 7 projects and require
  `error CA1416` at the probe. Injection: the two forms of the review again, `Engine.Core/Rev29PragmaProbe.cs` with a
  blanket pragma and `Engine.Kernel/.editorconfig` with `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Interoperability.severity =
  none`. The gate failed with both offences. The step failed with "Engine.Kernel: the build with CheckPlatformsProbe.cs
  gave no error CA1416", exit 1. A third form of the [Inferred] list, `AnalysisModeInteroperability` = `None`, also fails
  the step (exit 1). The form "a `SuppressMessage` over two lines" of the same [Inferred] list still escapes (T169).
- **T166** — Fixed for the three projects that it names. TASK-0263, v0.250. `3DEngine.App/3DEngine.App.csproj:15`,
  `3DEngine.Core/3DEngine.Core.csproj:10` and `3DEngine.Vulkan/3DEngine.Vulkan.csproj:16` set `TreatWarningsAsErrors`.
  The gate requires it (`DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:647` to `651`), and the step reads the evaluated property
  (`check-platforms.js:48`, `63` to `64`). Control: on the clean tree the step gives "the probe gives the error CA1416" for
  each of the 7 projects, exit 0. `3DEngine.Android`, which T166 also measured as `false`, still gives a warning only, and
  the question is in no register entry (T168). The text rule of the gate misses four project forms that only the step
  refuses (T170).
- **T167** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The affects field of ADR-0083 (`docs/adr/0083-the-mesh-body-and-the-stl-import.md:12`
  to `52`) names the eight files of T167, and ADR-0082 names `DesktopUi.Pad.cs` (`docs/adr/0082-...md:19`).
  `docs/diagnostics.md:78` names the handlers, not `DatumResolver`. The new gate `AffectsCitationGateTests` holds the
  rule. My Node.js mirror of the gate gives 27 offences at `31c3204` (the parent of the fix; 26 for ADR-0083 and 1 for
  ADR-0082, as the entry v0.250 says) and 0 at HEAD. Injection: `3DEngine.Core/Rev29CiteControl.cs` with
  `// ADR-0084 item 1` failed the gate, with that file as the only offence. The gate has holes of other forms (T171).
- **E172** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254. `3DEngine.App/PhoneLifecycle.cs`, `AfterWait`, reads the turn at each return of the
  wait, and `3DEngine.ImageTests/PhoneLifecycleTests.cs` holds its eight cases. An agent read the wait loop of
  `PhoneHost.cs` again and found no fault.
- **E173** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0269 (v0.254) and TASK-0274 (v0.257): the seven forms of v0.243 and the four forms
  of v0.250 in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs` give their earlier results. A probe of this review found other
  forms: E180, E181 and E182.
- **E174** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254, and TASK-0274, v0.257. `docs/demo-stl-test-sheet.md` says that the view, the
  selection and the line "Size" start again after the background, and how the size comes back.
- **E175** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. A lost surface in the frame that took a chosen STL gives the new part
  (`PhoneHost.cs:198`). The new path has a risk that no run examined (E184).
- **E176** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The host of a session comes after the checks of the turn and of the window, so each
  way out disposes it. An agent read each way out and found no fault.
- **E177** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `eng/android/check-apk.sh` fails when the APK holds no manifest or when node
  cannot read it (exit code 2).
- **E178** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `StlImportTests` holds a text file whose name is not UTF-8 and a cut binary file
  of fewer than 84 bytes.
- **E179** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each new window starts with no open dialog
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.FileDialog.cs`, `ResetDialog`). A late callback of an earlier window is a new form (V139).
- **V125** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. A request of a new part takes the slot of an open
  (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs`, `RequestNew`), and four tests of `StlOpenTests` hold the orders and the race.
- **V126** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. An accepted open ends the home screen. Its test raced with
  `DesktopSessionTests` on the runners; TASK-0278 (v0.262) runs the two classes in one collection.
- **V127** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A failed open from the home screen shows its message. The engine needs a window, so
  no test holds it.
- **V128** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. Each chip under the rows has its own place; an agent broke the push of the chips,
  and `BodyRowsTests` failed.
- **V129** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The state of a hidden body drops the kind first; `BodyRowsTests` holds it.
- **V130** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The home screen takes the taps and the keys, and the ring offers no Move for a mesh
  body (`StlOpenTests`, `ToolRingTests`).
- **V131** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A file dialog that fails gives a message. No test holds it.
- **V132** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. `HomeImageTests` checks "Open file", "New part" and the recent files.
- **V133** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The three comments are true. Other false comments are a new finding (V138).
- **T168** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. `3DEngine.Android/3DEngine.Android.csproj` makes CA1416 an error, and
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js` reads the property. A `NoWarn` in the host passes the step (T174).
- **T169** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each line of the code of the phone that names CA1416 is an offence of
  `DependencyDirectionGateTests`.
- **T170** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The gate refuses each form of `TreatWarningsAsErrors` that T170 named.
- **T171** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The affects gate reads the shaders and the PowerShell files; an agent put
  `// ADR-0083 item 9` into a `.vert` file, and the gate failed. A citation of an absent ADR is an offence.
- **T172** — Fixed. The entry v0.253 corrected the count of the ledger; the earlier review stays as it is.
- **T173** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The list "Shipped" of the roadmap is in the order of the ledger, and each close of
  v0.260 to v0.263 added its line at the end.
- **E180** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. `StlReader.Read` gives the result of the first of the rules of v0.243, of HEAD and of
  v0.250 that accepts a file; the forms with a zero byte are in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs`.
- **E181** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. The names that only v0.250 read get their result again (the same test file).
- **E182** — Open. Q1 of the review of 2026-11-07 (c) has the answer A under the standing order, written in ADR-0083 item 3;
  the owner did not answer it in the form of 2026-11-08.
- **E183** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The limit of a chosen STL is the limit of the store, and the read stops at it.
- **E184** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A lost surface waits for the foreground (`PhoneLifecycle.AfterLostSurface`).
- **E185** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The verb `asset` refuses a blank folder.
- **V134** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0280 (v0.265) and TASK-0284 (v0.269, two leads of Codex: the windows after the ring,
  and a window of the sketch at the left).
- **V135** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A release over a window is the tap of the window only.
- **V136** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The portrait ring stays above the anchors.
- **V137** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. A test holds the close of the second ring by a new selection.
- **V138** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The three comments say what the code does.
- **V139** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. `FileDialogState` gives each dialog its own number and filter. Its test raced with
  `WindowLifecycleTests`; TASK-0292 puts the two classes in one collection.
- **T174** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0281 (v0.266) and TASK-0285 (v0.270, a lead of Codex: the switches of the analyzers,
  and the probe build in the host that TASK-0281 named and did not add).

## 1 Current architecture

**[Observed]** The cone is the first primitive through the new capability `ISolidMeshOps` (ADR-0089): the engine computes a
closed mesh from the 64-gon of ADR-0040, Manifold stores it as a solid, and the owned kernel names its faces `-z` and
`side`. The STL reader gives each file the result of the first of three earlier rules that accepts it (ADR-0083 item 3).
The ring of a sketch keeps each tool in reach on each display, and the phone ends its engine as in the background at a lost
surface in the start or in a frame. The HTTP answer of a save lists its warnings (ADR-0090), and a start with `--file`
shows no home screen.

**[Observed]** The answers of the owner of 2026-11-08 started K5 (the cone shipped; the sphere and the torus wait), the
fonts (TASK-0292, after this commit), E164 and the start with `--file`. The agent proposal arc waits for its record.

## 2 Patterns in use

- **One table of the circle for each round body.** The cylinder, the cone and the work of K5d take their vertices from
  `SketchProfile.Turn`, so each is the same on each platform. **[Observed]**
- **A reader that keeps each earlier result.** The chain of rules of `StlReader` is the form of ADR-0083 item 3; an agent
  ran 1.9 million random files against five earlier readers with no lost result. **[Observed]**
- **A decision of the phone in `PhoneLifecycle`, and a test that reads the source of the host.** The loop of the phone runs
  on no computer here, so its rules are functions with tests, and the guards are checked in the text. **[Observed]**
- **The kernel turns a solid with a negative volume** (`KernelSolid.Closed`), so its face names stay right while the body of
  Manifold can be wrong (E186). **[Observed]**

## 3 Review of the code

### The engine, the kernel, the backend, the surface and the reader

#### E186 · Medium · An inward-wound mesh passes `CreateSolid` with no error, and no test of the cone catches it · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** `Engine.Geometry.Manifold/ManifoldGeometryBackend.cs`, `CreateSolid`, checks the status and an empty solid,
not the sign of `manifold_volume`. `Engine.Contracts/Geometry/ISolidMeshOps.cs` asks for triangles counter-clockwise from
outside. A probe of an agent gave `CreateSolid` the mesh of `Mesh(5, 10)` with each triangle reversed: Manifold took it with
the volume -261.379. A plate of 1600 less that cone kept 1718.94, more than before the cut; with the right cone it kept
1481.06. An injection of a full reversal in `CreateConeCommandHandler.Mesh` passed each test of the cone, because
`KernelSolid.Closed` turns a negative solid and the faces stay right. **[Inferred]** The mesh of v0.273 is right; a
winding fault of a later primitive would save a wrong body.

#### E187 · Low · The comment of `KernelSolid.Closed` sits above `Cone` · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `Engine.Kernel/KernelSolid.cs:103` to `104`: TASK-0288 put `Cone` between `Closed` and its comment.

#### E188 · Low · Messages and a header that the cone did not update · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `Engine.Core/Sketch/DatumResolver.cs`, lines 81, 93, 255 and 266, still say "No CreateBox, CreateCylinder or
Extrude in effect"; line 93 is the message for a cone that is not in effect at the place of the datum.
`Engine.Core/Features/KernelProjection.cs:11` lists the box and the cylinder only.

#### E189 · Low · A comment of the reader names a rule "of HEAD" · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `Engine.Core/Import/StlReader.cs:22` and `:55` say "the rule of HEAD"; HEAD moves with each commit.
ADR-0083 item 3 names it "the rule of v0.257 and later".

#### E190 · Medium · `E-STL-TOO-LARGE` now has a second meaning · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `docs/diagnostics.md` gives `E-STL-TOO-LARGE` the meaning "more triangles than the limit (300,000)".
`3DEngine.App/StlOpening.cs:22` to `30` gives it since TASK-0281 for each file of more than 16 MiB, so a text file with far
fewer triangles gets it; when SDL does not know the size, `Window.LoadFile` refuses the same file with no code
(`NativeThreeDEngine.cs:171` to `175`). `CLAUDE.md` says: do not change the meaning of a code.

#### E191 · Low · The cleanup of `Presenter` misses the objects of each frame · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.Vulkan/Presenter.cs:55` to `67`: the catch frees the swapchain and the render pass. When
`CreatePerFrame` throws after its first image, the fences, the command pools and the command buffers of the earlier images
stay. The comment says that the catch frees what the constructor made.

#### E192 · Low · The catch of `GraphicsDevice` can throw from `Dispose` · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.Vulkan/GraphicsDevice.cs:283` to `288` call `Dispose()`, which calls `WaitIdle()` with
`CheckResult()`. On a lost device that throws in the catch: the device, the messenger and the instance stay, and the new
exception replaces the first one, so the guard of the phone no longer matches it. The review of Codex of v0.272 gives
the same lead as medium. **[Inferred]** A lost surface does not lose the device, and a lost device ends the engine in each
case, so this review grades it low.

### The desktop, the phone and the tests

#### V141 · High · The program of the phone crashed in native code after a lost surface in the start of the engine · Confirmed by a run

**[Observed]** The main run of v0.273 (42433201851) failed in the job of the emulator; the five other runs of the same
code passed. The lines of the program, in their order: Android destroyed the first activity for a change of the
configuration (0x80000000); the session of the first activity ended before its window; the session of the second
activity wrote the determinism hash, lost the surface in `engine.Initialize()` (`PhoneHost.cs:171` to `179`, TASK-0286), and
ended its engine as in the background. 89 ms later Android destroyed the second activity with no change of the
configuration, and 717 ms later the process crashed: the first line that matched `eng/android/native-crash.ere` was the line
`Cmdline` of the tombstone. The determinism hash was the hash of the desktop runners.

**[Observed]** The job gives no more of the tombstone: the script gives the first line that matches only, and the log of the
job and the file of the log of Android need the rights of an administrator. The session read the paths of the surface:
each surface has one owner (`GraphicsDevice.cs:282` to `288`, `Presenter.cs:98`), and an engine whose device threw has no
object to free.

**[Observed]** The bytecode of the package `ppy.SDL3-CS` 2026.1002.1, read by a script: `SDLMain.run` calls `main()`, and
then, when `mSingleton` is not null and not finishing, sets `mSDLThread` to null and calls `mSingleton.finish()`.
`mSingleton` is static, so it is the newest activity. `SDLActivity.onDestroy` sends the quit and waits for `mSDLThread`
only when it is not null, and then calls `nativeQuit` in each case. **[Inferred]** The session of the
first activity returned from `Main` before its window (ADR-0079 item 4), so SDL finished the second activity: its surface
was lost in the start of the engine, and Android destroyed it with no change of the configuration. Because `mSDLThread`
was null, the destroy did not wait for the thread of the second session, and the end of SDL ran while that thread still
ran. Run 42323457861 of V124 (a destroy after the first frame) fits the same order. A person who installs the program sees
a crash when Android relaunches the activity at its start.

#### V140 · Low · While the second ring is open, the five tools have no place to tap · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** With a line selected and the second ring open at 1280 by 720, the ring holds the kinds and Back, and the
window of the sketch holds no Line, Select, Circle, Arc or Finish, because `ringHolds` is true
(`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Sketch.cs:65`). The text of ADR-0088 item 1 permits it; the reason of Q2 A ("a tool always has
a place") does not. The person taps Back first.

#### T175 · Low · The gate of the computer misses two ways to silence CA1416 in the phone host · Confirmed by injection

**[Observed]** `Engine.Tests/Governance/DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs`, the block of the host (TASK-0281, TASK-0285),
does not refuse `AnalysisMode*`, `AnalysisLevel*` or `CodeAnalysisTreatWarningsAsErrors`, as rule T170 does for the projects
that the host reaches, and no test checks the line `WarningsAsErrors` of the host. With
`<AnalysisModeInteroperability>None</AnalysisModeInteroperability>` in the host, or with that line removed, each of the 496
tests of the gates passed. **[Inferred]** The probe build of the step of the pipeline (TASK-0285) catches both.

#### T176 · Low · The test "each tool has a place" checks only that a button of the window exists · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.ImageTests/ToolRingTests.cs`, `Each_Tool_Of_The_Ring_Of_A_Sketch_Has_A_Place_That_A_Tap_Reaches`,
checks a segment by its middle and a button of the window by its rectangle only. At 390 by 844 the middle of Arc in the
window is at x 395, outside the display, and the window of the sketch (16 to 496) is wider than the display.

### Areas with no finding

**[Observed]** The resources of `CreateSolid` (an open mesh gives status 2, and the backend refuses it); the cone against
its kernel solid (equal volumes for five sizes); determinism (only `+ - * /` and `sqrt`); the creators of the cone; the
reader chain (1.9 million random files, 142 of the known E182 class); the HTTP answer of a save; the CLI; `FileDialogState`;
the start with `--file`; the phone lifecycle; the bounded read; the ring and `OverWindowAtRelease` (each injection failed a
test).

**[Inferred]** Not verified, for the next review: `Window.CreateSurface` throws a plain `Exception` when SDL cannot make the
surface, which `IsSurfaceLost` does not match; a landscape phone and the safe area of `SketchLayout`.

## 4 The next planned task

**[Observed]** V141 is high, so its task comes before the next product phase, R16i (the fonts, TASK-0292). E186 and E190
come after R16i, then the low findings.

## 5 Research for that task

- **V141.** **[Inferred]** A main function of a stale session that does not return keeps `mSingleton` and `mSDLThread` of
  the newest activity. **[Observed]** The tombstone of Android holds the signal, the thread, the abort message and the
  frames of the stack, with the name of each library; when the smoke test gives those lines as annotations, a next
  failure names the library.
- **E186.** **[Inferred]** `manifold_volume` exists in the binding (the test of the winding of ADR-0018 item 9 uses it), so
  `CreateSolid` can refuse a negative volume with the status of a fault, and a test can compare the volume of Manifold with
  the volume of the kernel.
- **E190.** **[Inferred]** A new code for a file too large for the store (for example `E-STL-FILE-TOO-LARGE`), registered
  in `docs/diagnostics.md`, keeps the meaning of `E-STL-TOO-LARGE`; the same code for an unknown size.

## 6 Recommended approach

**[Recommended]**
1. A task for V141: the main function of a stale session does not return, ADR-0079 item 4 says why, and the job gives the
   stack of a native crash. Then R16i (the fonts), then a task for E186 and E190 with a test of each, then a
   task for the low findings.
2. K5d waits for the answer of the owner on the speed of the exact kernel (the entry v0.273).

## Questions for the owner

- **Q1 (K5d).** A cut of a plate by a sphere of 3968 triangles took about 3 minutes in the exact kernel (about 12 s with
  960 triangles), and the recursive tree of the kernel overflowed the stack before a change that is not merged.
  - **A.** Make the exact kernel faster, for example by a filter of the boxes before the splits, then ship the sphere and
    the torus with the facets of ADR-0089.
  - **B.** Fewer facets for the sphere and the torus, against Q2 A of ADR-0089.
  - **C.** No exact kernel for a sphere and a torus: their faces lose their names in a cut.
  **Recommended: A.** It keeps the answers of ADR-0089. This changes no contract, but it is a choice of the owner on the
  plan of K5.
