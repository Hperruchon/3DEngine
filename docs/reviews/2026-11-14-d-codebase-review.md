# Codebase review — 2026-11-14 (d)

This document uses Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100). See `CLAUDE.md`, section "Language".

The review examines `89e8666`, the head of the branch of R21b at v0.355. The main run of v0.354 is red on a flaky test
(run 43562165193), so the owner must run it again before a merge; the tree of the merge of v0.355 will be the tree of this
commit. Four ledger entries follow the review of v0.351, with four product milestones (R18o, P0.148, R21a and R21b), so the
next product milestone needs this review first. The owner ordered work alone until Sunday on 2026-11-14. One agent examined
the code change from `7be5370` (v0.351) to `ce4217b`, the work commit of R21b, and probed its findings in a copy of the
commit. The session read each finding in the code at its line. Two findings were in R21b before its merge; TASK-0370 corrected
them on its branch. The review uses no lead of Codex.

## Summary

- **The four findings of the last review are fixed.** P0.148 (v0.353) fixed V181 to V183, and V184 for its form at the sizes
  of its test; V186 holds the form of a small landscape display. **[Observed]**
- **The agent found two faults of R21b before its merge.** On a phone of 360 pixels "not saved" of the top bar lay under the
  button "Views", and a digit in the two frames after Control and K gave a view. TASK-0370 corrected both before the merge,
  with a test each. **[Observed]**
- **Two new findings are high:** V185, a sketch that starts in a flat view keeps the flat view, so a sketch from the top view
  shows its plane edge-on and takes no point; and V186, the ends of the arc of a proposal lie on the tools of the ring on a
  small landscape display, as on a phone turned on its side. **[Observed]** by probes of the agent and by reading.
- **Three are medium:** V187 (the test of V160 proves nothing since P0.148), V188 (a zoom in a flat view puts the eye inside
  the part) and V189 (the edge lines in a flat view pull through faces up to about 2 mm). **[Observed]**
- **One is low:** V190 (the rows can cover the arc of a portrait display in the first frame of a proposal). **[Observed]** by
  reading.
- **Open findings: 0 critical, 4 high, 9 medium and 16 low.** **[Observed]**

## Measures

Each review repeats these measures at its commit, so that two reviews show how the code changes. A source
line is a line of a `.cs` or `.razor` file that git tracks. A script gives each count; at `a9cf69e` it gives each value of
the last review, so the method is the same.

| Measure | Value | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Projects in the solution | 17 | `.csproj` lines in `3DEngine.sln`. The last review gave 17; `3DEngine.Android` is outside the solution. |
| Production source lines | 40,671 (325 files) | Each tracked `.cs` and `.razor` file outside `Engine.Tests`, `3DEngine.Tests`, `3DEngine.ImageTests` and `3DEngine.VisionTests`. The last review gave 40,236 in 324 files. |
| Test source lines | 49,376: Engine.Tests (28,557 in 130 files), 3DEngine.Tests (3,983 in 24 files), 3DEngine.ImageTests (16,770 in 86 files) and 3DEngine.VisionTests (66 in 1 file) | The four test projects. The last review gave 48,780. |
| Tests | 2,603 | `dotnet test` of each test project at `89e8666`: 1,552, 370, 678 and 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. The last review gave 2,562. |
| Gate classes | 20 | Tracked files whose name ends in `GateTests.cs`. `eng/repo-gates` gives 488 runs of 168 checks. The last review gave 20, and 488 runs of 168 checks. |
| Build warnings (clean build) | 0 | `dotnet build 3DEngine.sln --no-incremental`. |
| Open register entries | 15 | Section "Open" of `docs/register.md`; the limit is 15. The last review gave 15. |
| ADRs | 130 | `docs/adr/0001` to `0061` and `0070` to `0138`, with 0003 and 0011 in `docs/adr/archive/`. In force: 128 (52 accepted, 76 amended). None is proposed. The last review gave 126. |
| Findings: critical | 0 | Each finding that is open at this commit, from any review. The last review gave 0. |
| Findings: high | 4 | The same method: T4, V141, V185, V186. The last review gave 2. |
| Findings: medium | 9 | The same method: E6, E13, E19, E21, T32, T37, V187, V188, V189. The last review gave 7; V181 is fixed, and V187 to V189 are new. |
| Findings: low | 16 | The same method: E17, E24, E34, E39, E57, E84, E160, V15, V29, V84, V88, T143, C1, P1, V143, V144, V190. The last review gave 19; V182 to V184 are fixed, and V190 is new. |
| Lines in the rule files | 3,575 | The ten rule files of `docs/reviews/2026-09-25-rules-review.md`, section 1, that still exist, counted with the method of that section. The last review gave 3,557. |
| Sentences with "must" | 61 | `grep -o -w -i must` on the same ten files. The last review gave 61. |
| Sentences with "do not" | 61 | `grep -o -i -E '\bdo not\b'` on the same ten files. The last review gave 61. |

A finding that is "fixed for its forms" counts as fixed: a new identifier holds each form that a later probe
found. E13, T32, E84, E160, V84 and V141 are fixed in part and count as open. A finding that the owner accepted counts as
closed.

## Findings of the previous review

The lines up to V180 are the lines of the review of 2026-11-14 (c). No open finding has a file in this range other than
those that this review names. The lines of V181 to V184 follow them.

  parts of R-0031 (Q1 A, 2026-11-10, TASK-0331); R-0031 closes when this part is fixed.
- **T5** — Fixed. TASK-0320, v0.303. The gates strip the quotes and the brackets of an `affects` list and refuse what stays.
- **T6** — Fixed. TASK-0043, v0.36. No change.

- **E158** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: each reader of a document file gives `E-IO-LOAD-FAILED` for a path that is not valid.
- **E159** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the host compares the unsaved folder with no case on Windows and macOS.
- **E160** — Fixed in part. The comment of `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs` has no change; `DatumResolver` changed only for the
  turn of a datum on a turned face (K8, TASK-0335).
- **E161** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the probe holds a circle, a cylinder, a move and a cut; run 42290937312 gave `1c56cbdd...30ba` on the four platforms.
- **E162** — Fixed. TASK-0241, v0.226: a save to a new name copies the lines into the new file and then deletes the old one.

- **V104** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: a cancelled finger is a touch sample with the phase Cancel.
- **V105** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0243, v0.228 showed the cause (a new start of the activity, run 42289169473), and TASK-0247, v0.231 sets the hint of a new start; a new start during a session is V112.
- **V106** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the line of the first frame comes after a submitted frame; no test, because the presenter needs a surface.
- **V107** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the outline of the face follows the offset of a drag.
- **V108** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: only `CancelIntent.ByKey` goes back from the face.
- **V109** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the entry of the face is kept by the geometry key of the body.
- **V110** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the comments say that no run shows the order of the background.
- **V111** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: ADR-0075 names the files of its items 2 and 3.
- **T152** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the comparison runs when the gate passed; run 42289169473 compared the three desktop hashes with the emulator job failed.
- **T153** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the smoke test fails on a native crash of the program.
- **T154** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224: the start is one notice, and the line "ended" is the text of the failure.
- **T155** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the pin rule decodes escapes, and a property in an Update or a Remove is an offence.
- **T156** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a Remove or an Update of a SupportedPlatform is an offence.
- **T157** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a hash with no line of the probe fails with its reason.
- **T158** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224 and TASK-0242, v0.229: each call of adb has a limit.
- **T159** — Fixed. The entry v0.225 names the seven runs; each later entry names its failed runs.
- **E164** — Fixed in part. TASK-0251, v0.237. `MoveTo` gives the path of a kept old file
  (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:191`), and `SaveAs` adds `W-IO-OLD-FILE-KEPT`
  (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` to `113`). A failed copy cuts the new file first (`DocumentJournal.cs:177`). The
  form with a cut that fails too is E168. Since TASK-0291 (v0.275, ADR-0090, the answer of the owner of 2026-11-08) the HTTP answer of a save lists the warning too.
- **E165** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Edges` gives each pair of names of an edge (`Engine.Core/Queries/GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:160`
  to `170`). The outline takes only an edge with a face of the name and a face of another name (`GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:131`).
  ADR-0077 item 6 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:99` to `102`) decides it. The probe gives 6 edges
  on the z axis. Its test is weak (E169).
- **E166** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs:3` to `6` names `CreateCylinder`.
- **V112** — Fixed. TASK-0250, v0.235. `Window` is `IDisposable` and destroys its SDL window one time
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.cs:27-45`); `PhoneHost.Run` disposes it at the end of the session (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:56`);
  `WindowLifecycleTests.cs:13-30` holds it. TASK-0255 (v0.238) adds the turns for a new create during a session.
- **V113** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Forget` removes the kept entry of a body with a fault (`3DEngine.App/BodyActions.cs:273-278`).
- **V114** — Fixed for an open panel. TASK-0252, v0.240. A size constraint and `KeepAboveAnchors` hold it
  (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Panel.cs:20`, `:30`, `:256-263`). A collapsed panel still covers Undo (V123).
- **V115** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The unit comes before the name (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:268-271`).
- **V116** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. While a list is open, each point belongs to the panel (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.cs:379-382`).
- **V117** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The host asks for the edge before the pick (`BodyActions.cs:79-83`).
- **V118** — Fixed for the panel, the anchors and the status line. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Window.SafeInsets` reads
  `SDL_GetWindowSafeArea` (`Window.cs:203-213`), and `DesktopUi.Fixed.cs:29`, `:45` and `DesktopUi.Panel.cs:19` read the
  inset. The tool ring does not read it (V122).
- **T160** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. The correction of the entry v0.237 (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md:7135` to `7145`) names 42280512471 the ninth failure and moves the later numbers by one. The API gives three failed runs after 42298165211: 42308415060, 42310351172 and 42313242154. The entries v0.237, v0.238 and v0.239 name each of them.
- **T161** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:1522` refuses `*` and `?` in the `Update` and the `Remove` of a package item. The comparison with the evaluated version stays open, as the entry v0.237 says (line `7131`).
- **T162** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:639`, `643`, `656` to `658` and `667`, and the new step `eng/android/check-platforms.js` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:251` to `252`). Two new silences pass each gate (T165). Three projects of the phone do not need a silence (T166).
- **T163** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `eng/android/native-crash.ere` holds three patterns, `eng/android/smoke-emulator.sh:127` gives them to `grep -E -f`, and line `76` reads the log again after 5 seconds. My `grep -E -f` probe matched the line of libc with `(eedengine.phone)` and the line `Cmdline:`, and did not match the line of `com.android.systemui`.
- **T164** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. The affects fields of ADR-0076 (`docs/adr/0076-the-cylinder.md:11` to `23`) and ADR-0077 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:11` to `20`) name the eight files. No gate compares an affects field with the commit of its task, and the defect came back in ADR-0082 and ADR-0083 (T167).
- **E167** — Fixed. TASK-0262, v0.245. `DocumentFile.Check` takes an `IAssetSource` and gives it to the scratch session (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentFile.cs:91`, `:96`). `DesktopDocument` keeps the store (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs:24-29`) and passes it to the check (`DesktopDocument.cs:97`). `DesktopSession.Open` gives the store of the desktop (`3DEngine/DesktopSession.cs:48-49`). The test `The_Check_Of_An_Open_Reads_The_Asset_Of_An_Import_From_The_Store` holds the probe of review 28 (`3DEngine.ImageTests/DesktopDocumentTests.cs:135-161`).
- **E168** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `MoveTo` keeps the results of the cut and the delete, and it throws an
  `IOException` that names the new file when both fail (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:178` to `186`,
  `:201` to `227`). `DocumentSession.SaveAs` gives that message in `E-IO-SAVE-FAILED` (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` and `:116`
  to `118`). ADR-0015 item 9 agrees (`docs/adr/0015-command-log-persistence.md:105` to `106`). The test
  `A_Failed_Copy_Whose_Cut_And_Delete_Fail_Names_The_New_File_In_The_Error` (`Engine.Tests/Persistence/DocumentFileTests.cs:796`)
  holds the form.
- **E169** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The test of an edge of four faces requires six edges on the axis and six
  different pairs of the four names (`Engine.Tests/Features/GetFacesTests.cs:293` to `298`). An injected list of two axis
  edges passed the old assert and failed the new one (entry v0.250).
- **E170** — Fixed for its three forms, and the fix has a regression. TASK-0263, v0.250. Probe `reader`: a cut binary
  file with a "solid" header gives `E-STL-TRUNCATED` (form 23), a name "facet" or "old endsolid copy" reads (form 17 and
  the test at `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs:100`), and a byte order mark reads (form 12). The new rule "the name
  is the rest of the line" refuses a one-line file with a line end, and it silently drops a facet that is on the line of
  `solid` (E173).
- **E171** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `apply` and `query` read `--kind` and `--folder` in any order before the first
  `--param` (`Engine.Cli/Cli.cs:473` to `501`), `export` reads `--folder` after its three words (`Cli.cs:198` to `207`),
  and `BuildSession` opens that store (`Cli.cs:521`). The usage says so (`Engine.Cli/Usage.cs:14` to `29`). Probe `cli`:
  `asset put --folder` and then `apply ImportStl --kind part --folder` gave `Applied`; a second `--folder` gave the usage
  error "'--folder' comes one time only"; `export stl a.3de b.stl --folder` with no path gave exit 2.
- **V119** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `OpenPad` clears `_pendingValue` (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Pad.cs:43-50`). `Use` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:87-89`), and `OpenDistancePad` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Pad.cs:58-62`). Test `The_Pad_Of_Another_Tool_Ends_The_Pending_Chip` (`3DEngine.ImageTests/EdgeValueTests.cs`, added by TASK-0264).
- **V120** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The ring skips a release on a chip of the last frame and on a row (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:386`); R20a (TASK-0341) kept the check and added that the press and the release are on the target of one segment. The chip skips a release on a row (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:55-58`). Test `A_Tap_On_A_Chip_Over_A_Segment_Gives_The_Chip_Only` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). Note: the ring reads the chips of the last frame (`Ring` runs before `Values`, `DesktopUi.cs:548-550`), so a chip that moves in this frame is one frame late. I found no case where this gives two tools.
- **V121** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The portrait segment is `min(0.42, (π/2 − (n−1)·0.04)/n)` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:97`). Theory `Each_Segment_Of_A_Portrait_Ring_Is_Between_The_Left_And_The_Top` (`ToolRingTests.cs`).
- **V122** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `Layout` takes the inset (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:92`, `:101`), and `Ring` passes `_inset` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:357`). Test `The_Portrait_Ring_Is_Inside_The_Safe_Area` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). No device ran it.
- **V123** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `KeepAboveAnchors` runs after `Begin` for each state (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:28-32`). The left clamp is `16 + _inset.X` (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:264`). The comment is next to the clamp and agrees with it (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:256-258`). Test `A_Collapsed_Panel_That_The_Person_Drags_Does_Not_Cover_Undo` (`FixedControlsTests.cs`).
- **V124** — Fixed in part. TASK-0265, v0.246. A lost surface in `engine.Render()` now gives `Session.Background`
  (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:177` to `185`), and the destroy line names `IsChangingConfigurations` and the mask
  (`3DEngine.Android/MainActivity.cs:303`). Two parts stay open. First, the wait for the foreground checks the turn only
  after 500 ms with no event, and a foreground event returns `true` with no check of the turn (`PhoneHost.cs:207` to
  `223`). ADR-0079 item 4 says that the wait ends a session whose turn is stale (E172). Second, the guard covers `Render`
  only: `engine.Initialize()` at `PhoneHost.cs:143` to `144` has no guard. The ledger says that no run executed the new
  path (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`, entry v0.246, "What stays"). The second part is fixed since TASK-0286 (v0.271): the start of the engine has the guard of a frame; TASK-0287 (v0.272) makes the support query of the surface check its result, so the guard takes it. The reviews of 2026-11-07 (b) and (c) counted V124 as fixed while this part was open.
- **T165** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `Engine.Tests/Governance/DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:666` to `669` refuse a
  `#pragma warning disable` with no code (the regex at line `689`). Lines `680` to `682` refuse each
  `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.` line in each `.editorconfig` and `.globalconfig` (the walk at lines `700` to `717`).
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js:33` to `42` and `66` to `78` build a probe call in each of the 7 projects and require
  `error CA1416` at the probe. Injection: the two forms of the review again, `Engine.Core/Rev29PragmaProbe.cs` with a
  blanket pragma and `Engine.Kernel/.editorconfig` with `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Interoperability.severity =
  none`. The gate failed with both offences. The step failed with "Engine.Kernel: the build with CheckPlatformsProbe.cs
  gave no error CA1416", exit 1. A third form of the [Inferred] list, `AnalysisModeInteroperability` = `None`, also fails
  the step (exit 1). The form "a `SuppressMessage` over two lines" of the same [Inferred] list still escapes (T169).
- **T166** — Fixed for the three projects that it names. TASK-0263, v0.250. `3DEngine.App/3DEngine.App.csproj:15`,
  `3DEngine.Core/3DEngine.Core.csproj:10` and `3DEngine.Vulkan/3DEngine.Vulkan.csproj:16` set `TreatWarningsAsErrors`.
  The gate requires it (`DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:647` to `651`), and the step reads the evaluated property
  (`check-platforms.js:48`, `63` to `64`). Control: on the clean tree the step gives "the probe gives the error CA1416" for
  each of the 7 projects, exit 0. `3DEngine.Android`, which T166 also measured as `false`, still gives a warning only, and
  the question is in no register entry (T168). The text rule of the gate misses four project forms that only the step
  refuses (T170).
- **T167** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The affects field of ADR-0083 (`docs/adr/0083-the-mesh-body-and-the-stl-import.md:12`
  to `52`) names the eight files of T167, and ADR-0082 names `DesktopUi.Pad.cs` (`docs/adr/0082-...md:19`).
  `docs/diagnostics.md:78` names the handlers, not `DatumResolver`. The new gate `AffectsCitationGateTests` holds the
  rule. My Node.js mirror of the gate gives 27 offences at `31c3204` (the parent of the fix; 26 for ADR-0083 and 1 for
  ADR-0082, as the entry v0.250 says) and 0 at HEAD. Injection: `3DEngine.Core/Rev29CiteControl.cs` with
  `// ADR-0084 item 1` failed the gate, with that file as the only offence. The gate has holes of other forms (T171).
- **E172** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254. `3DEngine.App/PhoneLifecycle.cs`, `AfterWait`, reads the turn at each return of the
  wait, and `3DEngine.ImageTests/PhoneLifecycleTests.cs` holds its eight cases. An agent read the wait loop of
  `PhoneHost.cs` again and found no fault.
- **E173** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0269 (v0.254) and TASK-0274 (v0.257): the seven forms of v0.243 and the four forms
  of v0.250 in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs` give their earlier results. A probe of this review found other
  forms: E180, E181 and E182.
- **E174** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254, and TASK-0274, v0.257. `docs/demo-stl-test-sheet.md` says that the view, the
  selection and the line "Size" start again after the background, and how the size comes back.
- **E175** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. A lost surface in the frame that took a chosen STL gives the new part
  (`PhoneHost.cs:198`). The new path has a risk that no run examined (E184).
- **E176** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The host of a session comes after the checks of the turn and of the window, so each
  way out disposes it. An agent read each way out and found no fault.
- **E177** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `eng/android/check-apk.sh` fails when the APK holds no manifest or when node
  cannot read it (exit code 2).
- **E178** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `StlImportTests` holds a text file whose name is not UTF-8 and a cut binary file
  of fewer than 84 bytes.
- **E179** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each new window starts with no open dialog
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.FileDialog.cs`, `ResetDialog`). A late callback of an earlier window is a new form (V139).
- **V125** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. A request of a new part takes the slot of an open
  (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs`, `RequestNew`), and four tests of `StlOpenTests` hold the orders and the race.
- **V126** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. An accepted open ends the home screen. Its test raced with
  `DesktopSessionTests` on the runners; TASK-0278 (v0.262) runs the two classes in one collection.
- **V127** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A failed open from the home screen shows its message. The engine needs a window, so
  no test holds it.
- **V128** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. Each chip under the rows has its own place; an agent broke the push of the chips,
  and `BodyRowsTests` failed.
- **V129** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The state of a hidden body drops the kind first; `BodyRowsTests` holds it.
- **V130** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The home screen takes the taps and the keys, and the ring offers no Move for a mesh
  body (`StlOpenTests`, `ToolRingTests`).
- **V131** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A file dialog that fails gives a message. No test holds it.
- **V132** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. `HomeImageTests` checks "Open file", "New part" and the recent files.
- **V133** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The three comments are true. Other false comments are a new finding (V138).
- **T168** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. `3DEngine.Android/3DEngine.Android.csproj` makes CA1416 an error, and
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js` reads the property. A `NoWarn` in the host passes the step (T174).
- **T169** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each line of the code of the phone that names CA1416 is an offence of
  `DependencyDirectionGateTests`.
- **T170** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The gate refuses each form of `TreatWarningsAsErrors` that T170 named.
- **T171** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The affects gate reads the shaders and the PowerShell files; an agent put
  `// ADR-0083 item 9` into a `.vert` file, and the gate failed. A citation of an absent ADR is an offence.
- **T172** — Fixed. The entry v0.253 corrected the count of the ledger; the earlier review stays as it is.
- **T173** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The list "Shipped" of the roadmap is in the order of the ledger, and each close of
  v0.260 to v0.263 added its line at the end.
- **E180** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. `StlReader.Read` gives the result of the first of the rules of v0.243, of HEAD and of
  v0.250 that accepts a file; the forms with a zero byte are in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs`.
- **E181** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. The names that only v0.250 read get their result again (the same test file).
- **E182** — Closed. The owner confirmed answer A on 2026-11-08 (the form after v0.297); TASK-0280 holds its code.
- **E183** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The limit of a chosen STL is the limit of the store, and the read stops at it.
- **E184** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A lost surface waits for the foreground (`PhoneLifecycle.AfterLostSurface`).
- **E185** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The verb `asset` refuses a blank folder.
- **V134** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0280 (v0.265) and TASK-0284 (v0.269, two leads of Codex: the windows after the ring,
  and a window of the sketch at the left).
- **V135** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A release over a window is the tap of the window only.
- **V136** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The portrait ring stays above the anchors.
- **V137** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. A test holds the close of the second ring by a new selection.
- **V138** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The three comments say what the code does.
- **V139** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. `FileDialogState` gives each dialog its own number and filter. Its test raced with
  `WindowLifecycleTests`; TASK-0292 puts the two classes in one collection.
- **T174** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0281 (v0.266) and TASK-0285 (v0.270, a lead of Codex: the switches of the analyzers,
  and the probe build in the host that TASK-0281 named and did not add).
- **E186** — Fixed. TASK-0295, v0.279. `CreateSolid` refuses a mesh whose volume is not positive; tests of the volume of
  the cone and of the refusal of reversed triangles (`Engine.Tests/Commands/CreateConeCommandTests.cs`).
- **E187** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The comment of `KernelSolid.Closed` is above `Closed`.
- **E188** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280, and TASK-0289, v0.282: the messages of `DatumResolver` and the header of
  `KernelProjection` name each creator of a body.
- **E189** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The reader names its second rule "the rule of v0.257 and later".
- **E190** — Fixed. TASK-0295, v0.279. The client gives `E-ASSET-TOO-LARGE` before the read and at a stopped read.
- **E191** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. `CreatePerFrame` frees the objects of the earlier images before it throws again.
- **E192** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. `Dispose` ignores the result of the wait of a lost device and destroys each object.
- **V140** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. While the second ring is open, the window of the sketch holds the tools and Finish.
- **V141** — Fixed in part. TASK-0294, v0.277. The main function of a stale session waits and does not return (ADR-0079
  item 5), from the bytecode of SDL; the smoke test gives the lines of a tombstone. No run repeated the relaunch, so no run
  shows the fix, and the finding counts as open.
- **T175** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The gate of the phone host refuses a mode or a level of the analysis and needs its
  `WarningsAsErrors`.
- **T176** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. Each place of a tool is on the display, and the window of the sketch is at most as
  wide as the display less its margins.
- **E193** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. A command that makes a sketch item refuses an identifier that an item of the sketch
  already holds.
- **E194** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. The backend refuses a volume below zero only, so a very small solid of an earlier
  document opens again.
- **E195** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The filter gives NaN for a value whose double is not normal, so the exact sign
  decides; ADR-0089 item 6 says so.
- **E196** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. A comment of `GetFacesQueryHandler` says that its cache belongs to the registry of
  one document session, and why.
- **T177** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. A gate refuses the markers of a conflict of git in a tracked text file.
- **V142** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. The main panel is at most as wide as the display less its margins.
- **T178** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The gate of the host reads each `WarningsAsErrors` and the last one of the host.
- **V143** — Open. TASK-0303, v0.288, names the race in ADR-0079 item 5 and in the comment of the activity; it is not fixed.
- **V144** — Open in part. TASK-0303, v0.288. ADR-0079 item 5 calls the cause of V141 inferred and names a second possible
  cause; no run shows the cause.
- **V145** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. `SceneRenderer.Dispose` goes on when the wait of a lost device fails.
- **T179** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The comment of the test of V141 says that it holds the text of the rule.
- **V146** — Fixed. TASK-0310, v0.294. The status line leaves Frame and Home free on each display.
- **V147** — Fixed. TASK-0311, v0.296. The dimension lines take the up axis of the camera.
- **V148** — Fixed. TASK-0308, v0.295. A landscape ring of a sketch draws the icons of Select, Circle and Finish.
- **V149** — Fixed. TASK-0311, v0.296. The top bar cuts the name to the room left of the rows; since TASK-0313 left of the
  command line.
- **V150** — Fixed. TASK-0311, v0.296. The comment of the panel says that the person does not move it.
- **V151** — Fixed. TASK-0311, v0.296. The comments of the camera, the yaw and the pitch name the up axis of each frame.
- **V152** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. The window of the live sketches is at the right, under the command line, in each frame.
  V159 is a side effect of that place.
- **V153** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. Each command of a cut has the text of its row and its own identifier.
- **V154** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. The window of the images starts under the top bar.
- **V155** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. Only the save that the question opened runs or drops the waiting change.
- **V156** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. The top bar takes the width of the command line on a landscape display only.
- **V157** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. The request of the focus stops where the field does not show.
- **E197** — Fixed. TASK-0324, v0.307. A step of the desktop surface puts a file that a request gave the session into the
  recent projects.
- **V158** — Closed by the answer Q5 C of the owner (2026-11-10, TASK-0331): commands turn the shelf. K8 (TASK-0335, v0.318) gives
  the command `Rotate`, and R-0057 is closed. The shelf of the owner is not turned yet; it is the file of the owner.
- **V159** — Fixed. TASK-0330, v0.313 (ADR-0107). With no ring of a body, the arc is in the room right of the panel, and the
  window of the live sketches does not show while a proposal waits. `ResponsiveLayoutTests` (R19) also holds Accept out of
  each panel at 13 sizes.
- **V160** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. The ring skips the targets of a proposal of the last frame
  (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:246-247`). A probe with an active sketch at 1440 by 900, 1280 by 720 and 1024 by 640 gave only the
  action of the proposal for each tap.
- **E198** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. The post refuses a repeated `commandId` (`ProposalsEndpoint.cs:71-81`), and the accept
  stops with `E-API-PROPOSAL-COMMAND-KNOWN` on a cached result (`Proposals.cs:112-122`).
- **V161** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. No read with no selection, and the read runs on the thread pool
  (`HistorySteps.cs:115-142`).
- **V162** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. The sheet ends above the ring when it fits there; else it covers the ring, as ADR-0111
  item 4 permits.
- **E199** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. The text of the refusal names the state of the proposal.
- **V163** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0331, v0.315. The window holds each listed action and intent while an accept runs.
  V165 holds a new form: the tap of the path line, which came later with R17a.
- **T180** — Fixed. TASK-0331, v0.315. The gate names the vision library with no version.
- **E200** — Fixed. TASK-0338, v0.320. `KernelProjection.ExactFrame` and `ExtrudeFace` (`Engine.Core/Features/KernelProjection.cs`)
  build the frame of a datum on a face in rationals, with the steps of the solid: the carrier frame of the face, each
  Translate, each Rotate through the nine numbers of the kernel, and the turned flip. The theories
  `A_Pocket_From_A_Datum_On_A_Moved_Or_Turned_Face_Opens_It` (each probe of the last review) and
  `A_Pocket_On_The_End_And_On_A_Side_Of_A_Post_Opens_Each_Face` run in the pipeline. **[Observed]**
- **V164** — Fixed. TASK-0339, v0.324. `ProposedValues` names only a distance or a radius as a length; an angle shows in
  degrees, and another kind keeps the line of its command. Test: `PendingChipTests`
  (`The_Line_Shows_An_Angle_In_Degrees_And_Names_No_Other_Kind_As_A_Length`). The angle is presentation in the client, so
  rule 1 of the determinism rules does not apply. **[Observed]**
- **E201** — Fixed. TASK-0339, v0.324. `Rotation.FromQuaternion` refuses a sum of squares under 2^-969, and the command
  gives E-GEOM-QUATERNION-TOO-SMALL. A probe of 2,000,000 random quaternions with parts from 2^-484 to 2^-620 accepted 17,368,
  and for each of them |RᵀR − I| was at most 7.8e-16, so no accepted turn scales a body. ADR-0114 item 5 records that an old log with
  such a turn now fails at replay. **[Observed]**
- **V165** — Fixed. TASK-0339, v0.324. `AcceptHold.Holds` frees `PathAction`, `FocusAction` and `EndFocusAction`. Test:
  `The_Path_Line_And_The_Focus_Are_Free_During_An_Accept`. **[Observed]**
- **T181** — Fixed. TASK-0339, v0.324. The host calls `AcceptHold.Held` and `AcceptHold.Pass`, which a test reads
  (`The_Host_Holds_Only_While_An_Accept_Runs`); `ResponsiveLayoutTests` checks each pair of windows, the sheet excepted. The
  armed tap on a face still reads a local flag in the host, with the same decision as before. **[Observed]**
- **V166** — Fixed. TASK-0345, v0.332. `EdgeLines.Feature` skips a triangle whose normal is zero (`EdgeLines.cs:60`). Test
  `A_Triangle_Of_Zero_Area_Across_A_T_Vertex_Adds_No_Edge` (`BodyEdgesImageTests.cs`). A sliver whose normal is very small
  but not zero still adds its edge. A T-vertex inside a closed flat face still gives false lines: V171. **[Observed]**
- **V167** — Fixed. TASK-0345, v0.332, ADR-0121. A mesh of more than 100 000 triangles (`EdgeLines.MostTrianglesAtUpload`)
  goes to the GPU with no lines, and the search runs on the thread pool; a rebuild or a removal drops the search of the old
  mesh. Tests `A_Mesh_Above_The_Count_Of_The_Upload_Finds_Its_Edges_On_The_Thread_Pool` and
  `A_Rebuild_Drops_The_Search_Of_The_Old_Mesh`. No test runs a real mesh of 100 000 triangles or more. **[Observed]**
- **V168** — Fixed. TASK-0350, v0.335, ADR-0123. The sketch that made a body is found along the first input of each step
  of the chain, and the history gives that step after the six newest when it is not one of them (`HistoryStep.MadeFrom`).
  Tests in `HistoryArcTests`: a plate cut two and three times, and the sketch of the cut body, not of the tool. **[Observed]**
- **V169** — Fixed. TASK-0350, v0.335. The ring skips a release anywhere on the rows. Two tests in `RingTapTests`, at 640
  by 360 and 1024 by 576. **[Observed]**
- **V170** — Fixed. TASK-0350, v0.335. The red state of a failed step and the plate of a wide label go through
  `GetColorU32`, so they fade. Test in `RingTapTests`. **[Observed]**
- **V171** — Fixed. TASK-0350, v0.335. A sliver joins its two short edges to the triangle across its long edge, when each
  of the three has one triangle. Two tests in `BodyEdgesImageTests`: a flat face and a crease. **[Observed]**
- **V172** — Fixed. TASK-0348, v0.334. ADR-0119 gives the span of four segments as 1.80 radians, as `RingSpan` does.
  **[Observed]**

- **V173** — Fixed. TASK-0356, v0.342, ADR-0129 item 2. The covers of the plates hold the panels and the fixed rectangles of
  the last frame. Test `DimensionLabelsTests.No_Plate_Is_Under_The_Window_Of_The_Live_Sketches`. V179 holds a second form:
  the arc of a proposal on a landscape display is no window. **[Observed]**
- **V174** — Fixed. TASK-0356, v0.342, ADR-0129 item 1. When the rows of the list of the hidden bodies do not fit, "Show
  all" comes first, then the bodies that fit, then "N more". Theory in `HiddenBodiesTests`. **[Observed]**
- **V175** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0356, v0.342, ADR-0129 item 4. A chain of collinear sides of one triangle each from end
  to end joins a side of one triangle; the area of a sliver is zero within 1e-9 of the square of its longest side. The agent
  of this review found T-vertices on both sides of a crack at different places ("a zipper") still give lines inside a flat
  face, as before the fix; ADR-0129 does not claim that form, and no probe showed that the backend gives it. A grid of
  960 000 triangles with T-vertices took 925 ms. **[Observed]**
- **V176** — Fixed. TASK-0356, v0.342, ADR-0129 item 2. Test `DimensionLabelsTests.A_Label_That_No_Move_Frees_Stays_At_Its_Place`.
  **[Observed]**
- **V177** — Fixed. TASK-0356, v0.342, ADR-0129 item 3. The window expects the text of a step for the identifier of its
  command. The agent of this review gave a second form, a value edit of the window that clears the texts of a running
  accept; the host holds each value edit while an accept runs (`AcceptHold.Held`), so it does not occur, as the review of
  2026-11-14 found for the first form. **[Observed]**

- **V178** — Fixed. TASK-0362, v0.348. The host gives the count of the log at the end of an accept, and the line shows "Undo"
  only while the count of the status is that count. Theory `ProposalWindowTests.A_Step_After_An_Accept_Takes_Undo_Away`. V182
  holds a later form: the host reads the count in the frame after the accept. **[Observed]**
- **V179** — Fixed. TASK-0362, v0.348. The arc of a landscape display keeps the boxes of its circles, its words, its caption,
  the plate of its lines and "AGENT IS WAITING", and the plates of the next frame take them as covers. Test
  `DimensionLabelsTests.No_Plate_Is_Under_The_Arc_Of_A_Proposal`. **[Observed]**
- **V180** — Fixed. TASK-0362, v0.348. The mix test checks Reject and Accept at each size. **[Observed]**

- **V181** — Fixed. TASK-0367, v0.353, ADR-0136 item 3. The whole caption under the arc wraps at its spaces into lines that fit
  the chord. Theory `ProposalCaptionTests.A_Caption_Longer_Than_The_Chord_Shows_Whole_Under_The_Arc`. **[Observed]**
- **V182** — Fixed. TASK-0367, v0.353. The step texts keep the count of the log after each applied command, and the line takes
  the count after the last command of the proposal. Test
  `FixedStatusTests.The_Count_After_A_Proposal_Is_The_Count_At_Its_Last_Command`. **[Observed]**
- **V183** — Fixed. TASK-0367, v0.353. The left limit tests the edge of the plate farther from the centre. Theory
  `ProposalPlaceTests.A_Block_That_Moves_Left_Stays_Inside_The_Inner_Circle`. **[Observed]**
- **V184** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0367, v0.353, ADR-0136 item 1. Accept and its word lie on no tool at 1440 by 900. V186
  holds two later forms: Reject is not tested, and on a small landscape display no angle frees Accept. **[Observed]**

## 1 Current architecture

No boundary changed from v0.351 to v0.355. **[Observed]** The code changes are in the window and its host (`3DEngine.App`),
in the render-side kernel (`3DEngine.Core`: the camera, the pick, the gizmo and the input samples) and in the input of SDL
(`3DEngine.Vulkan`). No change is in `Engine.*`, so no command, query, event or diagnostic code is new. **[Observed]**

## 2 Patterns in use

- **A new state of the camera that the old writers of the camera do not know.** R21a gave the camera a flat view, and
  `SketchCamera.Face` still sets only the yaw and the pitch (V185); a zoom keeps the eye at the distance of the scale (V188).
  A new state needs a list of each writer of the state it changes. **[Observed]**
- **A rule that its test reaches at one size only**, again: the ends of the arc lie on no tool at 1440 by 900, the size of its
  test, and lie on the tools at 640 by 360 and 832 by 384 (V186). **[Observed]**
- **A test whose control a fix removed.** P0.148 made the scene of the test of V160 free of the case it tested, and changed its
  control to an assertion that is always true (V187). **[Observed]**

## 3 Review of the code

#### V185 · High · A sketch that starts in a flat view keeps the flat view · Confirmed

- **Evidence.** `SketchCamera.Face` (`3DEngine.Core/Sketching/SketchCamera.cs:33-35`) sets the pitch and the yaw and does not
  leave a flat view, and `Camera` uses the pitch of the flat view for Top and Bottom. The host calls `Face` when a sketch
  starts (`3DEngine.App/NativeThreeDEngine.cs:703`, `:722`). A probe of the agent: in the top view, a sketch on the front
  plane keeps the view from the top, so its plane is edge-on and a tap at the centre gives no point on it; in the front view,
  a sketch on the plane of x and y gives a flat view "Front" that looks almost down, and the net marks Front. **[Observed]**
- **Impact.** A person who uses the views and then sketches cannot draw. **[Observed]**
- **Correction.** `Face` leaves the flat view, as an orbit does; a test for each of the two cases. **[Recommended]**

#### V186 · High · The ends of the arc of a proposal lie on the tools of the ring on a small landscape display · Confirmed

- **Evidence.** `ArcEnd` (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Proposal.cs`) tests Accept and its word only, and ends the arc at 305
  degrees when no angle frees Accept. A probe of the agent with a selected face and 16 places of the centre: at 640 by 360
  Accept lies on Move and Set distance at each place; at 832 by 384 and 915 by 412 Reject lies on Move or Set distance in 20
  layouts; at 800 by 480 in 8. The test of V184 uses 1440 by 900 only. **[Observed]**
- **Impact.** On a phone turned on its side, a tool under an end of the arc takes no tap while a proposal waits, against
  ADR-0136 item 1. **[Observed]**
- **Correction.** Test Reject and its word too, and when no end of the arc can be free, move the ring of the arc as R18n does;
  test the small landscape sizes. **[Recommended]**

#### V187 · Medium · The test of V160 proves nothing since P0.148 · Confirmed

- **Evidence.** `ProposalArcTests.A_Tap_On_An_End_Uses_No_Tool_Of_The_Ring` ends with `Assert.True(onTools >= 0)`, which is
  always true, because no point of its scene lies on a tool since ADR-0136. **[Observed]**
- **Impact.** The guard that gives a tap on an end over a tool to the proposal only has no test, and V186 shows that case.
  **[Observed]**
- **Correction.** A scene where an end lies on a tool, and the control `onTools >= 1` again. **[Recommended]**

#### V188 · Medium · A zoom in a flat view puts the eye inside the part · Confirmed

- **Evidence.** `Camera.Zoom` changes the distance, and a flat view takes its scale from the distance (`HalfHeight`), so the
  eye moves with the scale. A probe of the agent: a cube of 100 mm, framed, in the front view, at ten times the size: the eye
  is at y = -34.4 and the front face at y = -50, so the face is cut and a pick starts behind it. **[Observed]**
- **Impact.** A zoom of more than about seven times in a flat view cuts the part. **[Observed]**
- **Correction.** A scale of its own for a flat view, with the eye behind the box of the scene. **[Recommended]**

#### V189 · Medium · The edge lines in a flat view pull through faces up to about 2 mm · Calculated

- **Evidence.** `3DEngine.Vulkan/Shaders/edge.vert:60` multiplies the depth by 1.002. With perspective the depth is near 1/d;
  with the depth of a flat view, which is linear, the pull is 0.002 times the distance to the far plane: about 2 mm for a part
  of 20 mm, and 21 mm for a part of 1000 mm. **[Inferred]** The agent did not check it on a GPU.
- **Impact.** In a flat view an edge behind a face within that band shows as a visible line. **[Inferred]**
- **Correction.** A pull for a flat view, as an offset of the depth in the space of the view. **[Recommended]**

#### V190 · Low · The rows can cover the arc of a portrait display in the first frame of a proposal · Confirmed by reading

- **Evidence.** The rows read `_arcBottom` of the frame before (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Rows.cs`), which is null in the first
  frame of a new proposal. **[Observed]** by reading.
- **Impact.** One frame. **[Inferred]**
- **Correction.** The place of the arc of a portrait display from the display alone, so the rows know it in the same frame.
  **[Recommended]**

## 4 The next planned task

V185 and V186 are high, so TASK-0373 (P0.149) holds them, and V187 with V186, before the next product phase, R21c (Frame in
the free part of the scene, TASK-0372). TASK-0374 (P0.150) holds V188 to V190 after R21c.

## 5 Research for that task

- **V185.** `Camera.Orbit` leaves the flat view; `Face` can do the same, or the camera can give a method that both call.
- **V186.** `RightOfRows` moves the ring of the arc; the same move can free the tools on a small landscape display.
- **V187.** A ring with a selected face at 640 by 360 has an end on a tool today.

## 6 Recommended approach

TASK-0373 first, then R21c, then TASK-0374. **[Recommended]**

## Questions for the owner
