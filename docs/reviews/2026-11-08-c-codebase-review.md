# Codebase review — 2026-11-08 (c)

This document uses Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100). See `CLAUDE.md`, section "Language".

The review examines `main` at `42f85ad`, the merge of v0.292. Seven ledger entries follow the review of v0.285, with four
product milestones (R16j, R16k, R16l and R16m), so the next product milestone would make the review late. The four
milestones are the first slices of the redesign that the owner chose on 2026-11-08. One agent examined the code change from
v0.288 to the change of R16m at `8525341`, whose code is the code of `42f85ad`, and proved its main findings with probes
that it deleted. The owner stopped the reviews of Codex on 2026-11-08, so this review uses no lead of Codex.

## Summary

- **The fixes of the last review hold.** E193, E194, T177, V142, E195, E196, T178, V145 and T179 are fixed. V143 and V144
  are named, not fixed. **[Observed]**
- **One new finding is high.** V146: on a phone of 390 by 844 the status line of R16j covers Frame and Home, and a tap on
  them does nothing. **[Observed]** by a probe.
- **Two new findings are medium.** **[Observed]**
  - V147: the dimension lines (`Dimensions.Of`) still take the y axis as up, so with the camera of R16m they do not follow
    the eye.
  - V148: on a landscape ring of a sketch, Select, Circle and Finish draw no icon, against ADR-0095 item 3.
- **Three new findings are low:** V149, V150 and V151. **[Observed]**
- **Open findings: 0 critical, 6 high, 17 medium and 24 low.** **[Observed]**

## Measures

Each review repeats these measures at its commit, so that two reviews show how the code changes. A source
line is a line of a `.cs` or `.razor` file that git tracks.

| Measure | Value | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Projects in the solution | 17 | `.csproj` lines in `3DEngine.sln`. The last review gave 17; `3DEngine.Android` is outside the solution. |
| Production source lines | 34,181 | Each tracked `.cs` and `.razor` file outside `Engine.Tests`, `3DEngine.Tests`, `3DEngine.ImageTests` and `3DEngine.VisionTests`, 308 files. The last review gave 33,857 in 307 files. |
| Test source lines | 39,993 | `Engine.Tests` (26,871 in 123 files), `3DEngine.Tests` (3,712 in 22 files), `3DEngine.ImageTests` (9,345 in 58 files) and `3DEngine.VisionTests` (65 in 1 files). The last review gave 39,630. |
| Tests | 2,179 | `dotnet test 3DEngine.sln` at the change of R16m: 1,472, 350, 354 and 3 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. The last review gave 2,145. |
| Gate classes | 20 | Tracked files whose name ends in `GateTests.cs`. `eng/repo-gates` gives 478 runs of 165 checks. The last review gave 20, and 470 runs of 163 checks. |
| Build warnings (clean build) | 0 | `dotnet build 3DEngine.sln --no-incremental`. |
| Open register entries | 15 | Section "Open" of `docs/register.md`; the limit is 15. The last review gave 15. |
| ADRs | 88 | `docs/adr/0001` to `0061` and `0070` to `0096`, with 0003 and 0011 in `docs/adr/archive/`. In force: 85 (40 accepted, 45 amended). One is proposed (0092). The last review gave 84. |
| Findings: critical | 0 | Each finding that is open at this commit, from any review. The last review gave 0. |
| Findings: high | 6 | The same method: V2, V3, T4, T31, V141, V146. The last review gave 5. |
| Findings: medium | 17 | The same method: E5, E6, E12, E13, E19, E21, E22, V4, T2, T5, T10, T17, T32, T37, E182, V147, V148. The last review gave 19; E193, E194, T177 and V142 are fixed. |
| Findings: low | 24 | The same method: E17, E24, E34, E39, E57, E84, E160, V7, V15, V29, V84, V88, T7, T13, T23, T25, T143, C1, P1, V143, V144, V149, V150, V151. The last review gave 26; E195, E196, T178, V145 and T179 are fixed. |
| Lines in the rule files | 3,089 | The ten rule files of `docs/reviews/2026-09-25-rules-review.md`, section 1, that still exist, counted with the method of that section. The last review gave 3,066. |
| Sentences with "must" | 59 | `grep -o -w -i must` on the same ten files. The last review gave 59. |
| Sentences with "do not" | 55 | `grep -o -i -E '\bdo not\b'` on the same ten files. The last review gave 55. |

A finding that is "fixed for its forms" counts as fixed: a new identifier holds each form that a later probe
found. E13, T32, E84, E160, V84 and V141 are fixed in part and count as open. A finding that the owner accepted counts as
closed.

- **E158** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: each reader of a document file gives `E-IO-LOAD-FAILED` for a path that is not valid.
- **E159** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the host compares the unsaved folder with no case on Windows and macOS.
- **E160** — Fixed in part. TASK-0242, v0.229, for the reasons of `DatumResolver`; the comment of `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs` stays, because the task forbade `Engine.Contracts`.
- **E161** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the probe holds a circle, a cylinder, a move and a cut; run 42290937312 gave `1c56cbdd...30ba` on the four platforms.
- **E162** — Fixed. TASK-0241, v0.226: a save to a new name copies the lines into the new file and then deletes the old one.
- **E163** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the bus refuses a null required field with `E-CMD-FIELD-MISSING`.
- **V104** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: a cancelled finger is a touch sample with the phase Cancel.
- **V105** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0243, v0.228 showed the cause (a new start of the activity, run 42289169473), and TASK-0247, v0.231 sets the hint of a new start; a new start during a session is V112.
- **V106** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the line of the first frame comes after a submitted frame; no test, because the presenter needs a surface.
- **V107** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the outline of the face follows the offset of a drag.
- **V108** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: only `CancelIntent.ByKey` goes back from the face.
- **V109** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the entry of the face is kept by the geometry key of the body.
- **V110** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: the comments say that no run shows the order of the background.
- **V111** — Fixed. TASK-0243, v0.228: ADR-0075 names the files of its items 2 and 3.
- **T152** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the comparison runs when the gate passed; run 42289169473 compared the three desktop hashes with the emulator job failed.
- **T153** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the smoke test fails on a native crash of the program.
- **T154** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224: the start is one notice, and the line "ended" is the text of the failure.
- **T155** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: the pin rule decodes escapes, and a property in an Update or a Remove is an offence.
- **T156** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a Remove or an Update of a SupportedPlatform is an offence.
- **T157** — Fixed. TASK-0242, v0.229: a hash with no line of the probe fails with its reason.
- **T158** — Fixed. TASK-0239, v0.224 and TASK-0242, v0.229: each call of adb has a limit.
- **T159** — Fixed. The entry v0.225 names the seven runs; each later entry names its failed runs.
- **E164** — Fixed in part. TASK-0251, v0.237. `MoveTo` gives the path of a kept old file
  (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:191`), and `SaveAs` adds `W-IO-OLD-FILE-KEPT`
  (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` to `113`). A failed copy cuts the new file first (`DocumentJournal.cs:177`). The
  form with a cut that fails too is E168. Since TASK-0291 (v0.275, ADR-0090, the answer of the owner of 2026-11-08) the HTTP answer of a save lists the warning too.
- **E165** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Edges` gives each pair of names of an edge (`Engine.Core/Queries/GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:160`
  to `170`). The outline takes only an edge with a face of the name and a face of another name (`GetFacesQueryHandler.cs:131`).
  ADR-0077 item 6 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:99` to `102`) decides it. The probe gives 6 edges
  on the z axis. Its test is weak (E169).
- **E166** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `Engine.Contracts/Sketch/DatumRecord.cs:3` to `6` names `CreateCylinder`.
- **V112** — Fixed. TASK-0250, v0.235. `Window` is `IDisposable` and destroys its SDL window one time
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.cs:27-45`); `PhoneHost.Run` disposes it at the end of the session (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:56`);
  `WindowLifecycleTests.cs:13-30` holds it. TASK-0255 (v0.238) adds the turns for a new create during a session.
- **V113** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Forget` removes the kept entry of a body with a fault (`3DEngine.App/BodyActions.cs:273-278`).
- **V114** — Fixed for an open panel. TASK-0252, v0.240. A size constraint and `KeepAboveAnchors` hold it
  (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Panel.cs:20`, `:30`, `:256-263`). A collapsed panel still covers Undo (V123).
- **V115** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The unit comes before the name (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:268-271`).
- **V116** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. While a list is open, each point belongs to the panel (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.cs:379-382`).
- **V117** — Fixed. TASK-0252, v0.240. The host asks for the edge before the pick (`BodyActions.cs:79-83`).
- **V118** — Fixed for the panel, the anchors and the status line. TASK-0252, v0.240. `Window.SafeInsets` reads
  `SDL_GetWindowSafeArea` (`Window.cs:203-213`), and `DesktopUi.Fixed.cs:29`, `:45` and `DesktopUi.Panel.cs:19` read the
  inset. The tool ring does not read it (V122).
- **T160** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. The correction of the entry v0.237 (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md:7135` to `7145`) names 42280512471 the ninth failure and moves the later numbers by one. The API gives three failed runs after 42298165211: 42308415060, 42310351172 and 42313242154. The entries v0.237, v0.238 and v0.239 name each of them.
- **T161** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:1522` refuses `*` and `?` in the `Update` and the `Remove` of a package item. The comparison with the evaluated version stays open, as the entry v0.237 says (line `7131`).
- **T162** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. `DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:639`, `643`, `656` to `658` and `667`, and the new step `eng/android/check-platforms.js` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:251` to `252`). Two new silences pass each gate (T165). Three projects of the phone do not need a silence (T166).
- **T163** — Fixed. TASK-0251, v0.237. `eng/android/native-crash.ere` holds three patterns, `eng/android/smoke-emulator.sh:127` gives them to `grep -E -f`, and line `76` reads the log again after 5 seconds. My `grep -E -f` probe matched the line of libc with `(eedengine.phone)` and the line `Cmdline:`, and did not match the line of `com.android.systemui`.
- **T164** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0251, v0.237. The affects fields of ADR-0076 (`docs/adr/0076-the-cylinder.md:11` to `23`) and ADR-0077 (`docs/adr/0077-a-tap-near-an-edge-selects-the-edge.md:11` to `20`) name the eight files. No gate compares an affects field with the commit of its task, and the defect came back in ADR-0082 and ADR-0083 (T167).
- **E167** — Fixed. TASK-0262, v0.245. `DocumentFile.Check` takes an `IAssetSource` and gives it to the scratch session (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentFile.cs:91`, `:96`). `DesktopDocument` keeps the store (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs:24-29`) and passes it to the check (`DesktopDocument.cs:97`). `DesktopSession.Open` gives the store of the desktop (`3DEngine/DesktopSession.cs:48-49`). The test `The_Check_Of_An_Open_Reads_The_Asset_Of_An_Import_From_The_Store` holds the probe of review 28 (`3DEngine.ImageTests/DesktopDocumentTests.cs:135-161`).
- **E168** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `MoveTo` keeps the results of the cut and the delete, and it throws an
  `IOException` that names the new file when both fail (`Engine.Core/Persistence/DocumentJournal.cs:178` to `186`,
  `:201` to `227`). `DocumentSession.SaveAs` gives that message in `E-IO-SAVE-FAILED` (`Engine.Core/DocumentSession.cs:108` and `:116`
  to `118`). ADR-0015 item 9 agrees (`docs/adr/0015-command-log-persistence.md:105` to `106`). The test
  `A_Failed_Copy_Whose_Cut_And_Delete_Fail_Names_The_New_File_In_The_Error` (`Engine.Tests/Persistence/DocumentFileTests.cs:796`)
  holds the form.
- **E169** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The test of an edge of four faces requires six edges on the axis and six
  different pairs of the four names (`Engine.Tests/Features/GetFacesTests.cs:293` to `298`). An injected list of two axis
  edges passed the old assert and failed the new one (entry v0.250).
- **E170** — Fixed for its three forms, and the fix has a regression. TASK-0263, v0.250. Probe `reader`: a cut binary
  file with a "solid" header gives `E-STL-TRUNCATED` (form 23), a name "facet" or "old endsolid copy" reads (form 17 and
  the test at `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs:100`), and a byte order mark reads (form 12). The new rule "the name
  is the rest of the line" refuses a one-line file with a line end, and it silently drops a facet that is on the line of
  `solid` (E173).
- **E171** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `apply` and `query` read `--kind` and `--folder` in any order before the first
  `--param` (`Engine.Cli/Cli.cs:473` to `501`), `export` reads `--folder` after its three words (`Cli.cs:198` to `207`),
  and `BuildSession` opens that store (`Cli.cs:521`). The usage says so (`Engine.Cli/Usage.cs:14` to `29`). Probe `cli`:
  `asset put --folder` and then `apply ImportStl --kind part --folder` gave `Applied`; a second `--folder` gave the usage
  error "'--folder' comes one time only"; `export stl a.3de b.stl --folder` with no path gave exit 2.
- **V119** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `OpenPad` clears `_pendingValue` (`3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Pad.cs:43-50`). `Use` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:87-89`), and `OpenDistancePad` sets it after the open (`DesktopUi.Pad.cs:58-62`). Test `The_Pad_Of_Another_Tool_Ends_The_Pending_Chip` (`3DEngine.ImageTests/EdgeValueTests.cs`, added by TASK-0264).
- **V120** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The ring skips a release on a chip of the last frame and on a row (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:126-132`). The chip skips a release on a row (`DesktopUi.Values.cs:55-58`). Test `A_Tap_On_A_Chip_Over_A_Segment_Gives_The_Chip_Only` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). Note: the ring reads the chips of the last frame (`Ring` runs before `Values`, `DesktopUi.cs:548-550`), so a chip that moves in this frame is one frame late. I found no case where this gives two tools.
- **V121** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. The portrait segment is `min(0.42, (π/2 − (n−1)·0.04)/n)` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:86`). Theory `Each_Segment_Of_A_Portrait_Ring_Is_Between_The_Left_And_The_Top` (`ToolRingTests.cs`).
- **V122** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `Layout` takes the inset (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:81`, `:87`), and `Ring` passes `_inset` (`DesktopUi.Ring.cs:121`). Test `The_Portrait_Ring_Is_Inside_The_Safe_Area` (`ToolRingTests.cs`). No device ran it.
- **V123** — Fixed. TASK-0264, v0.251. `KeepAboveAnchors` runs after `Begin` for each state (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:28-32`). The left clamp is `16 + _inset.X` (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:264`). The comment is next to the clamp and agrees with it (`DesktopUi.Panel.cs:256-258`). Test `A_Collapsed_Panel_That_The_Person_Drags_Does_Not_Cover_Undo` (`FixedControlsTests.cs`).
- **V124** — Fixed in part. TASK-0265, v0.246. A lost surface in `engine.Render()` now gives `Session.Background`
  (`3DEngine.Android/PhoneHost.cs:177` to `185`), and the destroy line names `IsChangingConfigurations` and the mask
  (`3DEngine.Android/MainActivity.cs:303`). Two parts stay open. First, the wait for the foreground checks the turn only
  after 500 ms with no event, and a foreground event returns `true` with no check of the turn (`PhoneHost.cs:207` to
  `223`). ADR-0079 item 4 says that the wait ends a session whose turn is stale (E172). Second, the guard covers `Render`
  only: `engine.Initialize()` at `PhoneHost.cs:143` to `144` has no guard. The ledger says that no run executed the new
  path (`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`, entry v0.246, "What stays"). The second part is fixed since TASK-0286 (v0.271): the start of the engine has the guard of a frame; TASK-0287 (v0.272) makes the support query of the surface check its result, so the guard takes it. The reviews of 2026-11-07 (b) and (c) counted V124 as fixed while this part was open.
- **T165** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. `Engine.Tests/Governance/DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:666` to `669` refuse a
  `#pragma warning disable` with no code (the regex at line `689`). Lines `680` to `682` refuse each
  `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.` line in each `.editorconfig` and `.globalconfig` (the walk at lines `700` to `717`).
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js:33` to `42` and `66` to `78` build a probe call in each of the 7 projects and require
  `error CA1416` at the probe. Injection: the two forms of the review again, `Engine.Core/Rev29PragmaProbe.cs` with a
  blanket pragma and `Engine.Kernel/.editorconfig` with `dotnet_analyzer_diagnostic.category-Interoperability.severity =
  none`. The gate failed with both offences. The step failed with "Engine.Kernel: the build with CheckPlatformsProbe.cs
  gave no error CA1416", exit 1. A third form of the [Inferred] list, `AnalysisModeInteroperability` = `None`, also fails
  the step (exit 1). The form "a `SuppressMessage` over two lines" of the same [Inferred] list still escapes (T169).
- **T166** — Fixed for the three projects that it names. TASK-0263, v0.250. `3DEngine.App/3DEngine.App.csproj:15`,
  `3DEngine.Core/3DEngine.Core.csproj:10` and `3DEngine.Vulkan/3DEngine.Vulkan.csproj:16` set `TreatWarningsAsErrors`.
  The gate requires it (`DependencyDirectionGateTests.cs:647` to `651`), and the step reads the evaluated property
  (`check-platforms.js:48`, `63` to `64`). Control: on the clean tree the step gives "the probe gives the error CA1416" for
  each of the 7 projects, exit 0. `3DEngine.Android`, which T166 also measured as `false`, still gives a warning only, and
  the question is in no register entry (T168). The text rule of the gate misses four project forms that only the step
  refuses (T170).
- **T167** — Fixed. TASK-0263, v0.250. The affects field of ADR-0083 (`docs/adr/0083-the-mesh-body-and-the-stl-import.md:12`
  to `52`) names the eight files of T167, and ADR-0082 names `DesktopUi.Pad.cs` (`docs/adr/0082-...md:19`).
  `docs/diagnostics.md:78` names the handlers, not `DatumResolver`. The new gate `AffectsCitationGateTests` holds the
  rule. My Node.js mirror of the gate gives 27 offences at `31c3204` (the parent of the fix; 26 for ADR-0083 and 1 for
  ADR-0082, as the entry v0.250 says) and 0 at HEAD. Injection: `3DEngine.Core/Rev29CiteControl.cs` with
  `// ADR-0084 item 1` failed the gate, with that file as the only offence. The gate has holes of other forms (T171).
- **E172** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254. `3DEngine.App/PhoneLifecycle.cs`, `AfterWait`, reads the turn at each return of the
  wait, and `3DEngine.ImageTests/PhoneLifecycleTests.cs` holds its eight cases. An agent read the wait loop of
  `PhoneHost.cs` again and found no fault.
- **E173** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0269 (v0.254) and TASK-0274 (v0.257): the seven forms of v0.243 and the four forms
  of v0.250 in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs` give their earlier results. A probe of this review found other
  forms: E180, E181 and E182.
- **E174** — Fixed. TASK-0269, v0.254, and TASK-0274, v0.257. `docs/demo-stl-test-sheet.md` says that the view, the
  selection and the line "Size" start again after the background, and how the size comes back.
- **E175** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. A lost surface in the frame that took a chosen STL gives the new part
  (`PhoneHost.cs:198`). The new path has a risk that no run examined (E184).
- **E176** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The host of a session comes after the checks of the turn and of the window, so each
  way out disposes it. An agent read each way out and found no fault.
- **E177** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `eng/android/check-apk.sh` fails when the APK holds no manifest or when node
  cannot read it (exit code 2).
- **E178** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. `StlImportTests` holds a text file whose name is not UTF-8 and a cut binary file
  of fewer than 84 bytes.
- **E179** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each new window starts with no open dialog
  (`3DEngine.Vulkan/Window.FileDialog.cs`, `ResetDialog`). A late callback of an earlier window is a new form (V139).
- **V125** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. A request of a new part takes the slot of an open
  (`3DEngine/DesktopDocument.cs`, `RequestNew`), and four tests of `StlOpenTests` hold the orders and the race.
- **V126** — Fixed. TASK-0270, v0.255. An accepted open ends the home screen. Its test raced with
  `DesktopSessionTests` on the runners; TASK-0278 (v0.262) runs the two classes in one collection.
- **V127** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A failed open from the home screen shows its message. The engine needs a window, so
  no test holds it.
- **V128** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. Each chip under the rows has its own place; an agent broke the push of the chips,
  and `BodyRowsTests` failed.
- **V129** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The state of a hidden body drops the kind first; `BodyRowsTests` holds it.
- **V130** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The home screen takes the taps and the keys, and the ring offers no Move for a mesh
  body (`StlOpenTests`, `ToolRingTests`).
- **V131** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. A file dialog that fails gives a message. No test holds it.
- **V132** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. `HomeImageTests` checks "Open file", "New part" and the recent files.
- **V133** — Fixed. TASK-0271, v0.258. The three comments are true. Other false comments are a new finding (V138).
- **T168** — Fixed for its form. TASK-0272, v0.259. `3DEngine.Android/3DEngine.Android.csproj` makes CA1416 an error, and
  `eng/android/check-platforms.js` reads the property. A `NoWarn` in the host passes the step (T174).
- **T169** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. Each line of the code of the phone that names CA1416 is an offence of
  `DependencyDirectionGateTests`.
- **T170** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The gate refuses each form of `TreatWarningsAsErrors` that T170 named.
- **T171** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The affects gate reads the shaders and the PowerShell files; an agent put
  `// ADR-0083 item 9` into a `.vert` file, and the gate failed. A citation of an absent ADR is an offence.
- **T172** — Fixed. The entry v0.253 corrected the count of the ledger; the earlier review stays as it is.
- **T173** — Fixed. TASK-0272, v0.259. The list "Shipped" of the roadmap is in the order of the ledger, and each close of
  v0.260 to v0.263 added its line at the end.
- **E180** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. `StlReader.Read` gives the result of the first of the rules of v0.243, of HEAD and of
  v0.250 that accepts a file; the forms with a zero byte are in `Engine.Tests/Import/StlImportTests.cs`.
- **E181** — Fixed. TASK-0280, v0.265. The names that only v0.250 read get their result again (the same test file).
- **E182** — Open. Q1 of the review of 2026-11-07 (c) has the answer A under the standing order, written in ADR-0083 item 3;
  the owner did not answer it in the form of 2026-11-08.
- **E183** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The limit of a chosen STL is the limit of the store, and the read stops at it.
- **E184** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A lost surface waits for the foreground (`PhoneLifecycle.AfterLostSurface`).
- **E185** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The verb `asset` refuses a blank folder.
- **V134** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0280 (v0.265) and TASK-0284 (v0.269, two leads of Codex: the windows after the ring,
  and a window of the sketch at the left).
- **V135** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. A release over a window is the tap of the window only.
- **V136** — Fixed. TASK-0281, v0.266. The portrait ring stays above the anchors.
- **V137** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. A test holds the close of the second ring by a new selection.
- **V138** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. The three comments say what the code does.
- **V139** — Fixed. TASK-0282, v0.267. `FileDialogState` gives each dialog its own number and filter. Its test raced with
  `WindowLifecycleTests`; TASK-0292 puts the two classes in one collection.
- **T174** — Fixed for its forms. TASK-0281 (v0.266) and TASK-0285 (v0.270, a lead of Codex: the switches of the analyzers,
  and the probe build in the host that TASK-0281 named and did not add).
- **E186** — Fixed. TASK-0295, v0.279. `CreateSolid` refuses a mesh whose volume is not positive; tests of the volume of
  the cone and of the refusal of reversed triangles (`Engine.Tests/Commands/CreateConeCommandTests.cs`).
- **E187** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The comment of `KernelSolid.Closed` is above `Closed`.
- **E188** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280, and TASK-0289, v0.282: the messages of `DatumResolver` and the header of
  `KernelProjection` name each creator of a body.
- **E189** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The reader names its second rule "the rule of v0.257 and later".
- **E190** — Fixed. TASK-0295, v0.279. The client gives `E-ASSET-TOO-LARGE` before the read and at a stopped read.
- **E191** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. `CreatePerFrame` frees the objects of the earlier images before it throws again.
- **E192** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. `Dispose` ignores the result of the wait of a lost device and destroys each object.
- **V140** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. While the second ring is open, the window of the sketch holds the tools and Finish.
- **V141** — Fixed in part. TASK-0294, v0.277. The main function of a stale session waits and does not return (ADR-0079
  item 5), from the bytecode of SDL; the smoke test gives the lines of a tombstone. No run repeated the relaunch, so no run
  shows the fix, and the finding counts as open.
- **T175** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. The gate of the phone host refuses a mode or a level of the analysis and needs its
  `WarningsAsErrors`.
- **T176** — Fixed. TASK-0296, v0.280. Each place of a tool is on the display, and the window of the sketch is at most as
  wide as the display less its margins.
- **E193** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. A command that makes a sketch item refuses an identifier that an item of the sketch
  already holds.
- **E194** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. The backend refuses a volume below zero only, so a very small solid of an earlier
  document opens again.
- **E195** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The filter gives NaN for a value whose double is not normal, so the exact sign
  decides; ADR-0089 item 6 says so.
- **E196** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. A comment of `GetFacesQueryHandler` says that its cache belongs to the registry of
  one document session, and why.
- **T177** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. A gate refuses the markers of a conflict of git in a tracked text file.
- **V142** — Fixed. TASK-0302, v0.287. The main panel is at most as wide as the display less its margins.
- **T178** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The gate of the host reads each `WarningsAsErrors` and the last one of the host.
- **V143** — Open. TASK-0303, v0.288, names the race in ADR-0079 item 5 and in the comment of the activity; it is not fixed.
- **V144** — Open in part. TASK-0303, v0.288. ADR-0079 item 5 calls the cause of V141 inferred and names a second possible
  cause; no run shows the cause.
- **V145** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. `SceneRenderer.Dispose` goes on when the wait of a lost device fails.
- **T179** — Fixed. TASK-0303, v0.288. The comment of the test of V141 says that it holds the text of the rule.

## 1 Current architecture

**[Observed]** The desktop draws the layout of the render "mix": a top bar, a panel with no title bar and no ground, the
status line at the lower right (ADR-0093), a framed part that fills 45 % of the half picture (ADR-0094), and a ring with a
guide, icons and a caption (ADR-0095). The camera of the session has the z axis up (ADR-0096): `Camera.ZUp` turns the frame
of y up of the yaw and the pitch by a quarter turn about x, and the view, the ray of a pick, the overlay of a sketch and the
gizmo take `Camera.UpAxis`. No command, no event and no contract changed in these four slices.

## 2 Patterns in use

- **A height from the last frame.** The panel takes its height from its content in the last frame (`_panelHeight`), because
  a window that sizes itself hides its items in its first frame. **[Observed]**
- **One frame of the screen in four places.** `Camera.View`, `Picker.RayThrough`, `SketchOverlay.Frame` and
  `TranslateGizmo.View` each build the right and the up of the screen; since TASK-0307 each takes `UpAxis`. V147 shows a
  fifth place that reads the side of the eye with its own rule of y up. **[Observed]**
- **A window that comes later in the frame is on top.** The status window comes after the anchors, so it takes the hover
  where the two overlap (V146). **[Observed]**

## 3 Review of the code

### The desktop and the camera

#### V146 · High · On a phone the status line covers Frame and Home, and a tap on them does nothing · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Fixed.cs:95` puts the window `##Status` at the lower right with the pivot
(1, 0.5), so its text grows to the left over the row of the anchors. It comes after `##Anchors` in the frame, so it is on
top. A probe at 390 by 844 with three bodies (the phone has no address) found the status line at x 114 to 374, Frame at
140 to 228 and Home at 240 to 324; a tap at the centre of Frame and of Home gave no action, and Redo, at x 100, gave its
action. At 844 by 390 with the address of the desktop, the status line (x 284 to 828) covers the right part of Home.
`FixedControlsTests` checks the place of the status line at 1280 by 720 only. **[Inferred]** On the S23 Frame and Home do
not work since v0.289.

#### V147 · Medium · The dimension lines still take the y axis as up · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.Core/Measuring/Dimensions.cs:30` to `48` choose the sides of the box from `eye.X` and `eye.Z`, put
the lines of X and Z at `min.Y`, and say "The up axis of the desktop is Y". `DimensionOverlay` passes `camera.Eye()`. With
the camera of ADR-0096 the height of the eye picks a side, and the side of the eye in y is not read. **[Inferred]** An
orbit from a yaw of 135° to 45° moves the eye from +y to -y and does not move the lines, so the line of X lies across the
top face. No probe ran.

#### V148 · Medium · A landscape ring of a sketch draws no icon on Select, Circle and Finish · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Ring.cs:293` takes each label of a ring of a sketch wider than 56 pixels as a wide
label with a plate and no icon. Select (62), Circle (58) and Finish (59) are wider, so a probe at 1280 by 720 and 1440 by
900 found no `RingIconItem` for them, and found one for Line and Arc. ADR-0095 item 3 says that each of them has an icon.
The change of R16n (TASK-0308), not on `main` at this commit, keeps the icon of a tool with an icon.

#### V149 · Low · The top bar cuts the name of the file to the width of the rows, not to the room · Confirmed by a probe

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Fixed.cs:48` cuts the name to `RowsWidth` (360). A probe measured the top bar at x
16 to 534 with a long name. The rows of a selected body start at the width less 376, so on a window narrower than about
910 pixels the top bar overlaps the title of the rows.

#### V150 · Low · A comment of the panel says that the person can move it · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.App/Ui/DesktopUi.Panel.cs:16` and `17` say "The person can still move the panel, which the focus
click of ADR-0027 needs". Since TASK-0304 the panel has `NoMove` and its place is set in each frame.

#### V151 · Low · The comments of the yaw and the pitch are false for a camera with z up · Confirmed by reading

**[Observed]** `3DEngine.Core/Models/Camera.cs:12`, `149` and `160` say that the yaw turns about the y axis, that a yaw of
0 puts the eye on the positive z side, and that the pitch is above the plane of x and z. With `ZUp` each is false; the
summary of `ZUp` gives the meaning.

### Areas with no finding

**[Observed]** `ToWorld` is a rotation and `FromWorld` its inverse; the eye, the pan and the view agree for z up; the camera
of the session puts the eye on the positive side of x, y and z; `SketchCamera.Face` applies `Plain` after the turn; the
fill of the frame; no other frame of the screen of a fixed y up in `3DEngine.Core`, `3DEngine.App` and `3DEngine.Vulkan`
(the lighting is in the space of the view); `_panelHeight` is stable from the first frame; `_anchorsTop` is set before the
ring reads it; the rectangles of the icons, the labels and the caption agree with the drawing; no trigonometry reaches the
log.

## 4 The next planned task

**[Observed]** V146 is high, so a task for it comes before the next product phase: TASK-0310 (P0.129). Then R16n
(TASK-0308), whose change exists and fixes V148. Then the medium and low findings V147, V149, V150 and V151 (TASK-0311,
P0.130). Then the last slice of the owner, the command line.

## 5 Research for that task

- **V146.** **[Inferred]** The status line shows on the row of the anchors only when it fits between the right edge of the
  anchors and the right margin; else it drops the address, and when that does not fit, it does not show. A row above the
  anchors would cover the portrait ring, which is at the lower right.
- **V147.** **[Inferred]** `Dimensions.Of` can take the up axis of the camera, as the four frames of the screen do.

## 6 Recommended approach

**[Recommended]**
1. TASK-0310 for V146, with a test of a tap on Frame and Home at 390 by 844 and of the status line clear of the anchors at
   390, 844 and 1280.
2. Close R16n (TASK-0308).
3. TASK-0311 for V147, V149, V150 and V151.

## Questions for the owner

None. The questions of the first form of 2026-11-08 (the speed of a cut by a sphere, ADR-0092 Q1 to Q4 and E182) stay open.
