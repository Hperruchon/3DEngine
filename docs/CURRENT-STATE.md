# Current state

What is built today. One short entry per shipped milestone. Reference ADRs by ID; do not restate decisions.

## v0.1 — Engine Runtime spine (P0, TASK-0001)

In-memory, in-process Engine Runtime. No transport, no clients, no persistence, no geometry backend.

**Built:**
- `Engine.Contracts` — `Command`, `CommandResult`, `Outputs`, `Diagnostic`, `ErrorDetail`, `Query`, `QueryResult<T>`, `EventRecord`, `Document`, `BodyHandle`, capability marker interfaces (`IGeometryBackend`, `IMeshOps`, `IGeometryQuery`, `IBRepOps`, `IFeatureIdMap`), handler abstractions.
- `Engine.Core` — `CommandBus` (serial, atomic commit-at-end), `QueryBus` (empty registry), `CommandRegistry`, `QueryRegistry`, `InMemoryEventSink` (bounded ring), `Replay`, `DiagnosticCodes`, `NoOpCommand` + handler.
- `Engine.Tests` — 9 tests covering command application, version-stale rejection, query rejection, monotonic Seq, ring eviction, replay determinism.

**Verified by:** `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green.

**Decisions in force:** ADRs 0001–0008.

**Deferred:** HTTP/WS transport, CLI, concrete geometry backend, persistence, idempotency cache, schema endpoints, undo/redo. See V1 scope clamps in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## v0.2 — Engine.Cli (P1, TASK-0002)

In-process CLI per ADRs 0002, 0008. Verbs `apply` and `query`; JSON output to stdout. Only `NoOp` registered; query registry empty. Exit codes `0` Applied, `1` Rejected/Cancelled, `2` invalid usage. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green.

## v0.3 — Diagnostics registry CI gate (P2, TASK-0003)

Test-time gate enforcing CLAUDE.md's diagnostic-codes rule. Scans `Engine.Contracts/`, `Engine.Core/`, `Engine.Cli/` `.cs` sources for tokens matching `<E|W|I>-<SUBSYSTEM>-<tag>` and fails `dotnet test` if any are absent from `docs/diagnostics.md`. Implements the third gate in CLAUDE.md's gate list (after build and test). No production code changes; no new diagnostic codes. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (31 tests).

## v0.4 — `3DEngine.Core` peer render kernel (P3, TASK-0004, ADR-0009)

`3DEngine.Core` is now part of the authority diagram as a peer render kernel to `Engine.Core`. The two kernels are mutually unreferenceable; render-capable hosts reference both and own the projection (events → render state). No code, csproj, or test changes — documentation only. CLAUDE.md, the ADR index, and the roadmap updated accordingly. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (31 tests).

## v0.5 — Replay determinism CI gate (P4, TASK-0005)

Test-time gate completing CLAUDE.md's gate list (build, test, dependency direction, diagnostic codes registered, **replay determinism fixture**). A hand-authored fixture (three `NoOpCommand`s with stable `CommandId` GUIDs) is replayed via `Replay.ReplayLog`; the resulting `Document.Version`, `Document.Log`, and event sequence (`Seq`/`Kind`/`CauseCommandId`) are asserted against a hand-authored snapshot. A second test runs the replay twice and asserts the two runs match each other. Both modulo `Timestamp`/`DocumentId` per ADR-0005. No production code changes; no new diagnostic codes. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (33 tests).
