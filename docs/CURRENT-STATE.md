# Current state

What is built today. One short entry per shipped milestone. Reference ADRs by ID; do not restate decisions.

## v0.1 — Engine Runtime spine (P0, TASK-0001)

In-memory, in-process Engine Runtime. No transport, no clients, no persistence, no geometry backend.

**Built:**
- `Engine.Contracts` — `Command`, `CommandResult`, `Outputs`, `Diagnostic`, `ErrorDetail`, `Query`, `QueryResult<T>`, `EventRecord`, `Document`, `BodyHandle`, capability marker interfaces (`IGeometryBackend`, `IMeshOps`, `IGeometryQuery`, `IBRepOps`, `IFeatureIdMap`), handler abstractions.
- `Engine.Core` — `CommandBus` (serial, atomic commit-at-end), `QueryBus` (empty registry), `CommandRegistry`, `QueryRegistry`, `InMemoryEventSink` (bounded ring), `Replay`, `DiagnosticCodes`, `NoOpCommand` + handler.
- `Engine.Tests` — 9 tests covering command application, version-stale rejection, query rejection, monotonic Seq, ring eviction, replay determinism.

**Verified by:** `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green.

**Decisions in force:** ADRs 0001–0008.

**Deferred:** HTTP/WS transport, CLI, concrete geometry backend, persistence, idempotency cache, schema endpoints, undo/redo. See V1 scope clamps in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## v0.2 — Engine.Cli (P1, TASK-0002)

In-process CLI per ADRs 0002, 0008. Verbs `apply` and `query`; JSON output to stdout. Only `NoOp` registered; query registry empty. Exit codes `0` Applied, `1` Rejected/Cancelled, `2` invalid usage. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green.

## v0.3 — Diagnostics registry CI gate (P2, TASK-0003)

Test-time gate enforcing CLAUDE.md's diagnostic-codes rule. Scans `Engine.Contracts/`, `Engine.Core/`, `Engine.Cli/` `.cs` sources for tokens matching `<E|W|I>-<SUBSYSTEM>-<tag>` and fails `dotnet test` if any are absent from `docs/diagnostics.md`. Implements the third gate in CLAUDE.md's gate list (after build and test). No production code changes; no new diagnostic codes. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (31 tests).

## v0.4 — `3DEngine.Core` peer render kernel (P3, TASK-0004, ADR-0009)

`3DEngine.Core` is now part of the authority diagram as a peer render kernel to `Engine.Core`. The two kernels are mutually unreferenceable; render-capable hosts reference both and own the projection (events → render state). No code, csproj, or test changes — documentation only. CLAUDE.md, the ADR index, and the roadmap updated accordingly. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (31 tests).

## v0.5 — Replay determinism CI gate (P4, TASK-0005)

Test-time gate completing CLAUDE.md's gate list (build, test, dependency direction, diagnostic codes registered, **replay determinism fixture**). A hand-authored fixture (three `NoOpCommand`s with stable `CommandId` GUIDs) is replayed via `Replay.ReplayLog`; the resulting `Document.Version`, `Document.Log`, and event sequence (`Seq`/`Kind`/`CauseCommandId`) are asserted against a hand-authored snapshot. A second test runs the replay twice and asserts the two runs match each other. Both modulo `Timestamp`/`DocumentId` per ADR-0005. No production code changes; no new diagnostic codes. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (33 tests).

## v0.6 — Workflow gates (P5, TASK-0006)

`.github/` introduced: PR template, CODEOWNERS, and `workflows/ci.yml`. The workflow runs three jobs on push to `main` and on pull_request: **build-and-test** (`dotnet build` + `dotnet test`), **headless-smoke** (spawns the CLI binary and asserts NoOp's JSON output at process scope), and **contract-gate** (PR-only; fails when `Engine.Contracts/**` changes without a corresponding `docs/adr/**` change). No `Engine.*` code, test, or contract changes. V1 Pending is empty; the engine advances to V1.x.

## v0.7 — Engine.Api.Http scaffold (P6.1, TASK-0007)

First V1.x phase. New project `Engine.Api.Http` (ASP.NET Core minimal API) hosts `POST /commands` and `POST /queries` against an in-process engine, mirroring the CLI's dispatch and JSON shape. One command registered (`NoOp`); query registry empty. Transport errors (malformed body, missing required fields, wrong content-type, wrong method, unknown route) return `400`/`404`/`405`/`415` with an `E-API-BAD-REQUEST` envelope; engine verdicts always return `200` with the `CommandResult`/`QueryResult` JSON. New diagnostic code `E-API-BAD-REQUEST` registered in `docs/diagnostics.md`; new `API` subsystem token. References only `Engine.Core` and `Engine.Contracts` (authority diagram holds). No WebSocket, no idempotency cache, no schema endpoints — those are P6.2/P6.3/P6.4. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (44 tests).

## v0.8 — Idempotency cache (P6.2, TASK-0008)

`Engine.Core/IdempotencyCache.cs` lands a FIFO-evicting `Dictionary<Guid, CommandResult>` (default capacity 1024 per ADR-0006 §7). `CommandBus.Apply` checks the cache inside its serial section: on hit, the cached `CommandResult` is returned with no new event, log entry, or Seq increment. On miss, the bus runs as before and stores the result on the way out. All three terminal states (Applied, Rejected, Cancelled) are cached — a retried `CommandId` always gets the same answer, which is the point of the cache. `CommandBus`'s constructor gains an optional `IdempotencyCache` parameter; existing callers (CLI, HTTP host, tests) compile unchanged. CLAUDE.md V1 clamps tightened: idempotency-cache clamp dropped; HTTP-transport clamp narrowed to WebSocket-only. No `Engine.Contracts/**` change. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (52 tests).

## v0.9 — Schema endpoints (P6.4, TASK-0009)

Six `GET /schema/...` discovery endpoints on `Engine.Api.Http`, per ADR-0008 §9. Index endpoints (`/schema/commands`, `/schema/queries`) generate from `CommandRegistry`/`QueryRegistry` via a new `Registered` accessor. `/schema/events` lists the documented event kinds from ADR-0005 §7 (hand-encoded; will become registry-driven when an event registry lands). `/schema/diagnostics` mirrors `Engine.Core/DiagnosticCodes.cs`. Per-item command schemas are hand-known for `NoOp@1`; the full schema-declaration mechanism is deferred to P7's first concrete command. A new gate test (`SchemaEndpointGateTests`) enforces ADR-0008 §9's "every registered command has a schema entry" rule and the diagnostics-mirror invariant via reflection. No `Engine.Contracts/**` change; no new diagnostic code. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (61 tests).

## v0.10 — WebSocket event stream + reconnect (P6.3, TASK-0010, ADRs 0010 & 0011)

`GET /events` on `Engine.Api.Http` upgrades to WebSocket and delivers Document events with the cursor-based reconnect protocol of ADR-0005 §§4–5. The client sends one `subscribe { documentId?, lastSeenSeq? }` frame; the engine replies with `subscription.resume { fromSeq }` (cursor inside ring) followed by buffered + live events, or `subscription.reset { documentId, snapshot }` (cursor missing or stale) with the V1.x snapshot shape from ADR-0010 — `Document` metadata only, no `Log`, no render state. Per-subscriber bounded outbound channel (default 1024 per ADR-0005 §6); on overflow the engine closes the WebSocket with status `1008` + reason `subscriber.lagged` and other subscribers are unaffected. 30 s idle heartbeat (`{ "kind": "heartbeat" }`). New `BroadcastingEventSink` decorator wraps the existing `InMemoryEventSink`; `Engine.Core` is untouched. New diagnostic codes `W-API-WS-LAGGED` and `E-API-WS-INVALID-SUBSCRIBE` registered in `docs/diagnostics.md`, `DiagnosticCodes.cs`, and `/schema/diagnostics`. ADR-0011 frames the WebSocket as part of the canonical server-default deployment topology; ADR-0010 fixes the snapshot wire shape. `dotnet build` + `dotnet test` green (70 tests). P6 is complete.
